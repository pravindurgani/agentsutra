## Executive Summary

### Who This Is Built For

AgentSutra is a **single-user personal tool** built by and for one developer. It runs on a dedicated Mac Mini M2 sitting in a home office, controlled exclusively via Telegram by one authenticated user ID. It is not a SaaS product, not a multi-tenant platform, and not designed for public-facing deployment.

The user is the system's owner, operator, and sole consumer. There are no untrusted users, no public API endpoints, no shared infrastructure, and no compliance requirements.

### Why This Matters for Reviewers

Every architectural decision in this codebase was made through the lens of: **"What is the right engineering choice for a single-user personal system running on dedicated hardware?"** Reviewers applying enterprise/multi-tenant criteria will find gaps that are intentional, not oversights:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **SQLite, not PostgreSQL** | Single-user on one machine. SQLite handles thousands of writes/second with WAL mode. Connection pooling is unnecessary — connection-per-call with 20s timeout is simpler and correct for this workload. |
| **No LLM abstraction layer** | This is a Claude-powered system by design. Abstracting the provider adds complexity for a hypothetical migration that may never happen. If it does, the 5 node files are straightforward to adapt. |
| **Telegram-only interface** | The user controls the system from their phone. A REST API or web UI would add attack surface, authentication complexity, and maintenance burden for zero practical benefit. |
| **Blocklist + Docker + Opus audit, not a capability-based sandbox** | The threat model is LLM hallucination, not adversarial users. The blocklist catches accidental destructive commands. Docker isolates filesystem access. Opus audits output quality. These three layers are sufficient for a system where the only user is the owner. A capability-based sandbox (seccomp, AppArmor) would be over-engineering for this threat model. |
| **Docker isolation is opt-in, not default** | Many tasks require packages not pre-installed in the Docker image. Subprocess mode with the code content scanner provides adequate protection for a single-user system. Docker is recommended but not forced. |
| **No Prometheus/StatsD/structured logging** | `/cost`, `/health`, `/usage`, and `/status` commands provide all the observability a single operator needs. JSON logs and metrics exporters serve teams with dashboards and alerting infrastructure — this system has neither. |
| **No multi-user isolation** | `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is a flat allowlist. All users share `workspace/outputs/`. This is correct because there is one user. Per-user workspace isolation, RBAC, and tenant separation are multi-tenant concerns. |
| **Synchronous pipeline in `asyncio.to_thread()`** | The bot handles 5-30 tasks/day. The synchronous LangGraph pipeline occupies one thread for 15-60 seconds per task. With `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=3`, this uses 3 threads at peak. An async pipeline would add complexity for no measurable benefit at this scale. |
| **`psutil` RAM guard instead of cgroups** | Simple, cross-platform, sufficient. A Mac Mini with 16GB RAM serving one user does not need container-level memory isolation. |
| **APScheduler 3.x, not Celery** | Celery requires Redis/RabbitMQ infrastructure. APScheduler with SQLite persistence gives cron-like scheduling with zero external dependencies. Appropriate for a system running on one machine. |

### Design Philosophy

1. **Solve the actual problem.** The system exists to let one person send tasks from their phone and get results back. Every feature serves this goal.
2. **Defense-in-depth, not defense-in-perfection.** The blocklist is bypassable. Docker is optional. The code scanner is not a security boundary. But layered together — blocklist + code scanner + Docker + Opus audit + credential stripping + budget caps — they provide a robust safety net for a system where the threat is hallucination, not malice.
3. **Complexity must earn its place.** Every abstraction, every config option, every dependency was added because a real task required it. No speculative architecture. No "what if we need to scale" provisions.
4. **Ship, then harden.** The system went through 6 major versions. Each version shipped working features first, then hardened based on real stress tests and external reviews. This is reflected in the changelog — security was iteratively tightened, not designed upfront in a vacuum.

### Data Flow

1. User sends message or file to Telegram bot
2. `handlers.py` authenticates user via `@auth_required`, saves files, creates DB record
3. Sends initial status message, then streams stage updates (Classifying... Planning... Executing...)
4. `asyncio.to_thread()` offloads the synchronous LangGraph pipeline to a worker thread
5. LangGraph graph executes: classify --> plan --> execute --> audit --> deliver
6. Classifier checks project triggers first (fast path), falls back to Claude classification
7. For project tasks: executor generates shell script, `run_shell()` executes in project directory with venv
8. For code tasks: executor generates code, `run_code()` executes in sandbox subprocess
9. Auditor uses a DIFFERENT model (Opus) than executor (Sonnet) for adversarial cross-model review
10. On audit failure: retry loop feeds traceback + feedback back to planner (up to 3 retries)
11. For frontend/ui_design tasks: executor auto-starts local preview server; auditor runs Playwright visual check if enabled
12. Deliverer formats response, auto-deploys frontend artifacts if deployment is enabled, handler sends text + artifact files back via Telegram

## Every File Explained

### `main.py` - Entry Point
- Imports `config` first to ensure `.env` is loaded before any other module
- Configures logging to both console and `agentsutra.log` via `RotatingFileHandler` (10MB max, 3 backups) to prevent unbounded log growth (v6.5)
- Validates three required env vars: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` -- exits with clear error if any missing
- Initializes SQLite database tables via `asyncio.run(init_db())`
- **Storage cleanup (v6.2):** runs `prune_old_data()` (DB records) and `cleanup_workspace_files()` (output/upload files) on every startup
- Loads project registry from `projects.yaml` via `load_projects()`, logs count
- Creates Telegram bot application
- Hooks scheduler start/stop into bot lifecycle via `post_init` and `post_shutdown` so they share the same event loop
- Starts bot in long-polling mode with `drop_pending_updates=True` (ignores messages sent while bot was offline)

### `config.py` - Configuration
- Loads `.env` at import time via `python-dotenv`
- Defines all path constants: `BASE_DIR`, `WORKSPACE_DIR`, `UPLOADS_DIR`, `OUTPUTS_DIR`, `PROJECTS_DIR`, `DB_PATH`
- Auto-creates all workspace directories and `storage/` directory on import via `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`
- Parses `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` from comma-separated string to `list[int]`
- Defines two model tiers: `DEFAULT_MODEL` (Sonnet, for execution) and `COMPLEX_MODEL` (Opus, for auditing)
- All timeouts, limits, and model names configurable via environment variables
- Computes `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` from `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` for use in file validation
- Sets `TELEGRAM_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 4096` (Telegram API hard limit)
- **Deployment config (v8.1+):** `DEPLOY_ENABLED`, `DEPLOY_PROVIDER` (github_pages/vercel/firebase), `DEPLOY_REPO`, `DEPLOY_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_VERCEL_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_BASE_URL`, `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_PROJECT`, `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN`
- **Server config (v8.2):** `SERVER_START_TIMEOUT`, `SERVER_MAX_LIFETIME`, `SERVER_PORT_RANGE_START`, `SERVER_PORT_RANGE_END`
- **Visual check config (v8.3):** `VISUAL_CHECK_ENABLED`, `VISUAL_CHECK_TIMEOUT`

### `projects.yaml` - Project Registry (v2)
- YAML file defining 8 registered projects the agent can invoke instead of writing code from scratch
- Each project entry has: `name`, `path` (absolute), `description` (multiline, Claude reads this), `commands` (named shell commands with `{placeholder}` parameters), `timeout` (seconds), `requires_file` (boolean), `triggers` (keyword list for matching)
- Current projects: Affiliate Job Scraper, Jobs Analysis Pipeline v4, iGaming Intelligence Dashboard, Work Reports Generator, Domain Categorisation, Industry Voices Benchmarks, Suppliers Database, Newsletter Benchmarks
- Paths must be updated when transferring to a different machine

### `bot/telegram_bot.py` - Bot Setup
- Creates `ApplicationBuilder` with bot token from config
- Registers 19 command handlers: `/start`, `/status`, `/history`, `/usage`, `/cost`, `/health`, `/exec`, `/context`, `/cancel`, `/retry`, `/projects`, `/schedule`, `/chain`, `/debug`, `/deploy`, `/servers`, `/stopserver`, `/setup`, `/reindex`
- Registers file handlers (Document, Photo) before text handler to ensure proper routing
- Text handler is catch-all for non-command messages via `filters.TEXT & ~filters.COMMAND`

### `bot/handlers.py` - Request Handling (v6.2+: resource guards, rate limiter, v8 commands)
- `auth_required` decorator: wraps every handler, rejects Telegram users not in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`, uses `@functools.wraps` for proper function metadata
- `STAGE_LABELS` dict: maps internal stage names to user-friendly streaming status messages
- **`_check_resources()` (v6.2):** checks RAM usage via `psutil` and active task count before launching pipeline. Returns rejection message or None.
- `cmd_start`: sends welcome message listing capabilities and all 16 slash commands
- `cmd_status`: iterates `running_tasks` dict (v2: multiple concurrent tasks), shows stage for each via `get_stage()`
- `cmd_history`: queries last 5 tasks from DB, shows status indicators (done/err/stop/...)
- `cmd_usage`: displays session token counts from `claude_client.get_usage_summary()`
- `cmd_cost`: shows estimated API costs with per-model breakdown (calls, tokens, USD) from persistent usage DB
- **`cmd_health` (v6.2):** shows Python version, RAM usage (used/total/%), disk free, Ollama status, active tasks (N/max), API call count, token counts, estimated cost
- `cmd_exec`: executes a shell command directly via `run_shell()` with sandbox safety checks, runs from `HOST_HOME` with 60s timeout, returns stdout/stderr
- `cmd_context`: views recent conversation history (last 8 messages) and stored context; `/context clear` deletes all memory
- `cmd_cancel`: iterates all running task futures, calls `.cancel()` on each, updates DB status, clears stage tracking -- v2: handles multiple concurrent tasks
- `cmd_projects` (v2): imports and calls `get_projects()`, displays each project's name, commands, and top 3 triggers
- `cmd_schedule` (v2): parses `/schedule <minutes> <task>` format; subcommands: `list` (show all jobs), `remove <id>` (cancel job by partial ID prefix match); creates interval job via `add_interval_job()` using a module-level `_scheduled_task_run()` function (not a closure) so APScheduler's SQLAlchemyJobStore can serialize it for persistence
- **`cmd_chain` (v8.0):** parses `/chain step 1 -> step 2 -> step 3` with strict-AND semantics. Failed step halts chain. `{output}` passes artifacts between steps.
- **`cmd_debug` (v8.0):** per-task debug JSON — timings, verdict, retries, server/deploy URLs
- **`cmd_deploy` (v8.1):** manually deploy a task's frontend artifacts to configured provider
- **`cmd_servers` (v8.2):** list running local preview servers (port, PID, uptime)
- **`cmd_stopserver` (v8.2):** stop a server by task ID or stop all (`/stopserver all`)
- `_scheduled_task_run()`: module-level async function that creates a fresh `Bot` instance from `config.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, runs the full pipeline via `run_task()`, and sends results + artifacts to the originating chat. Accepts only serializable kwargs (`chat_id`, `user_id`, `task_message`). **v6.2:** checks RAM threshold before running, skips with warning if memory pressure. **v6.7:** wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=LONG_TIMEOUT)` to prevent indefinite hangs.
- `handle_message`: **v6.2:** enforces 5-second per-user rate limit and resource guards before pipeline launch. Creates DB record --> sends initial status message --> launches pipeline via `asyncio.to_thread()` --> streams stage updates by polling `get_stage()` every 3 seconds and editing the status message --> on completion, sends response text + artifact files --> updates DB with result
- `handle_document`: validates file size against `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`, downloads, saves via `save_upload()`, appends path to `pending_files` in user context, prompts user for instructions
- `handle_photo`: takes highest-resolution version `photo[-1]`, saves as `photo_<uuid>.jpg`
- `_send_long_message`: splits text at line boundaries respecting Telegram's 4096-char limit, hard-splits individual lines that exceed the limit

### `brain/state.py` - State Definition
- `AgentState(TypedDict)` with 23 fields across 10 groups:
  - **Input:** `task_id` (str), `user_id` (int), `message` (str), `files` (list of paths)
  - **Classification:** `task_type` (str: "code" | "data" | "file" | "automation" | "project" | "ui_design" | "frontend")
  - **Project (v2):** `project_name` (str), `project_config` (dict from projects.yaml)
  - **Planning:** `plan` (str)
  - **Execution:** `code` (str), `execution_result` (str)
  - **Audit:** `audit_verdict` (str: "pass" | "fail"), `audit_feedback` (str)
  - **Control:** `retry_count` (int), `stage` (str, for streaming status)
  - **Parameters:** `extracted_params` (dict), `working_dir` (str)
  - **Context:** `conversation_context` (str, recent history for planner), `auto_installed_packages` (list)
  - **Timing (v8.0):** `stage_timings` (dict, per-stage duration in seconds)
  - **Output:** `final_response` (str), `artifacts` (list of file paths), `server_url` (str, v8.2), `deploy_url` (str, v8.1)

### `brain/graph.py` - LangGraph Pipeline
- Thread-safe stage tracking via `_task_stages` dict protected by `threading.Lock` -- enables real-time streaming status to Telegram from the worker thread
- `set_stage()` / `get_stage()` / `clear_stage()`: thread-safe stage management
- `_wrap_node()`: wraps each pipeline node function to automatically call `set_stage()` with the node name before execution
- `build_graph()`: creates `StateGraph(AgentState)`, adds 5 nodes (classify, plan, execute, audit, deliver) with stage tracking wrappers, wires edges including conditional retry routing
- `should_retry()`: after audit, returns "deliver" if pass or max retries reached, "plan" otherwise
- `agent_graph`: module-level compiled graph singleton (built once at import)
- `run_task()`: populates initial state with all 23 fields defaulted (including `stage_timings`, `server_url`, `deploy_url`), invokes the compiled graph, clears stage tracking in `finally` block

### `brain/nodes/classifier.py` - Task Classification (v2: project-aware)
- **Fast path (v2):** calls `match_project()` first to check for trigger keyword matches before calling Claude; if matched, immediately returns `task_type: "project"` with project config -- no API call needed
- **Slow path:** sends message to Claude with classification prompt that includes all registered projects summary via `get_all_projects_summary()`
- 7 categories: `project` (v2), `frontend`, `ui_design`, `code`, `data`, `file`, `automation`
- **`_FALLBACK_ORDER` (v6.2.1):** module-level constant defining the keyword-scan priority order. Specific types first, generic "code" last. Tests import this directly to stay in sync.
- JSON response parsing with keyword-scan fallback for malformed responses using `_FALLBACK_ORDER`
- Uses minimal tokens (max_tokens=200) for fast classification
- If Claude classifies as "project" but fast path missed it, does a second `match_project()` call

### `brain/nodes/planner.py` - Plan Generation (v2 + v8: TDD, project mode, memory, file injection, security)
- **TDD_INSTRUCTION (v2):** constant appended to all non-project system prompts, instructs Claude to write `assert` statements that verify correctness -- data tasks assert row counts and column names, code tasks include at least 2 assertions, file tasks assert output exists, all end with "ALL ASSERTIONS PASSED"
- **CAPABILITIES_BLOCK:** shared system capabilities injected into all planner prompts (internet, runtime installs, Ollama, filesystem, shell, big data rules). Braces in code examples are escaped for `.format()` compatibility.
- **PROJECT_SYSTEM (v2):** dedicated system prompt for project tasks -- injects full project context (name, path, description, commands, timeout) via `get_project_context()`, explicitly instructs Claude to use existing commands instead of writing new code
- 6 additional task-type-specific system prompts: CODE_SYSTEM, DATA_SYSTEM, FILE_SYSTEM, AUTOMATION_SYSTEM, UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM, FRONTEND_SYSTEM -- each includes the TDD instruction + CAPABILITIES_BLOCK
- **SECURITY RESTRICTIONS block (v8.0.2):** injected into planner prompt — instructs LLM to refuse system credential file tasks instead of generating synthetic data
- **Coding standards injection (v8.0):** injects project-specific coding standards into the plan prompt when available
- **Cross-task memory injection (v8.0):** queries `project_memory` DB for relevant success/failure patterns and injects them into the planner prompt as "lessons learned"
- **Dynamic file injection (v8.0):** `_inject_project_files()` samples up to `MAX_FILE_INJECT_COUNT` (50) source files from the project directory, with path traversal validation via `.resolve() + startswith()` (v8.0.2 fix)
- Includes file contents for context (max 10K chars per file); large data files get metadata-only treatment
- On retry: appends audit feedback + previous execution output (up to 3K chars) to prompt, asks for revised plan

### `brain/nodes/executor.py` - Code Generation + Execution (v2: shell mode + traceback injection)
- Two execution paths based on task type:
  - **`_execute_project()` (v2):** generates a bash script from the plan using SHELL_GEN_SYSTEM prompt, executes via `run_shell()` with project's working directory and timeout, passes project's venv path if configured
  - **`_execute_code()`:** generates Python/JS code from the plan, strips markdown code blocks via regex, executes via `run_code()` in sandbox
- SHELL_GEN_SYSTEM (v2): instructs Claude to write bash scripts that activate venvs, change to correct directories, run commands in order, handle errors with `set -e`
- `_strip_markdown_blocks()`: extracts code from markdown fences using regex
- `_format_result()` (v2): formats `ExecutionResult` with full traceback injection -- if execution failed, the exact Python traceback (with file names and line numbers) is included, enabling the retry loop to fix the precise error
- Both paths guard against empty code generation

### `brain/nodes/auditor.py` - Quality Verification (v2 + v6.5 + v8.3: cross-model adversarial review, fail-safe defaults, visual check)
- **Cross-model auditing (v2):** executor uses `DEFAULT_MODEL` (Sonnet), auditor uses `COMPLEX_MODEL` (Opus) -- a different, more capable model reviews the work of the generating model, preventing the "echo chamber" effect where the same model approves its own output
- Strict evaluation criteria: checks exit code, assertion results (looks for "ALL ASSERTIONS PASSED"), traceback presence, output correctness, completeness
- v2: project-specific audit criteria -- checks that project commands actually ran and produced expected output
- **Visual verification (v8.3):** For frontend/ui_design tasks with a `server_url`, imports `tools.visual_check.check_page()` and appends visual context (loads, HTTP status, console errors) to the audit prompt before calling Opus. Gracefully skips on error.
- Returns JSON `{"verdict": "pass"|"fail", "feedback": "..."}` with `_extract_json()` fallback for malformed responses
- **Fail-safe defaults (v6.5):** missing verdict key defaults to `"fail"` (not `"pass"`), preventing broken output from being delivered. `retry_count` increments for ANY non-"pass" verdict (not just "fail"), preventing infinite retry loops from unexpected verdict values like `"partial"` or `"retry"`.
- On non-pass: increments `retry_count`; graph routes back to planner
- Uses `temperature=0.0` for deterministic auditing

### `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` - Response Formatting (v7 + v8: memory, deployment, screenshots)
- Formats final text response based on task type and audit verdict
- Project tasks (v2): shows project name in success message ("Project 'X' executed successfully.")
- Code tasks: includes code in backtick blocks (truncated at 3500 chars with note about attached file)
- Data/file/automation/project tasks: extracts Output section from execution result, strips error sections
- **Honest failure reporting (v7):** When verdict is FAIL, the deliverer injects hard constraints into the summary prompt — "This task FAILED. Do NOT claim files were created unless listed." Prevents Claude from fabricating success narratives based on the plan
- Failed tasks: clearly state what failed, include audit feedback, and never claim artifacts were generated unless they actually exist
- Lists artifact file count and names for attachment
- **Cross-task memory (v8.0):** Extracts success/failure patterns from execution results and stores them in `project_memory` DB table for future planner injection. Mines temporal sequences for recurring task patterns.
- **Screenshot attachment (v8.3):** Attaches `preview.png` screenshot to artifacts when visual check is enabled and server was running
- **Auto-deployment (v8.1):** For frontend/ui_design tasks that pass audit, calls `deployer.deploy()` to publish to the configured provider. Stores `deploy_url` in state.
- **Debug sidecar (v8.0):** Builds per-task debug JSON (timings, verdict, retries, server_url, deploy_url) for `/debug` command

### `tools/claude_client.py` - Claude API Wrapper
- Lazy client initialization via `_get_client()` -- only creates `Anthropic` client on first API call
- **Budget enforcement (v6.2):** `_check_budget()` runs before every API call. Queries daily and monthly spend from `api_usage` table against `DAILY_BUDGET_USD` / `MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD`. Raises `BudgetExceededError` (subclass of `RuntimeError`) if exceeded. Gracefully degrades on DB errors (allows call, logs warning).
- `call()`: sends message to Claude with retry logic (up to `MAX_RETRIES` attempts):
  - `RateLimitError`: exponential backoff starting at 4s
  - `APITimeoutError`: exponential backoff starting at 1s
  - `APIError`: exponential backoff with rethrow on final attempt
  - **Streaming for thinking calls (v7):** Uses `messages.stream()` with `get_final_message()` when thinking is enabled, avoiding Anthropic's 10-minute hard limit on non-streaming requests
  - **128k thinking headroom (v7):** Floors `max_tokens` at 128,000 when thinking is enabled to prevent thinking-only responses (where Claude consumes the entire token budget on thinking with zero text output)
  - **WARNING docstring (v2.2):** Explicitly warns that `time.sleep()` is safe only inside `asyncio.to_thread()` context
- **Persistent usage tracking (v2.2):** Every API call is persisted to SQLite (`api_usage` table in `agentsutra.db`) via synchronous `sqlite3` with `threading.Lock` for thread safety. Survives process restarts.
- `MODEL_COSTS` dict: per-model cost rates (input/output per 1M tokens) for Sonnet ($3/$15), Opus ($15/$75), Haiku ($0.80/$4)
- `_init_usage_db()`: lazily creates `api_usage` table (thread-safe, called once)
- `_persist_usage()`: inserts a single usage record under lock (v6.7: includes thinking_tokens)
- Validates non-empty response before returning `response.content[0].text`
- `call_complex()`: shortcut that forces `COMPLEX_MODEL` (Opus) with `max_tokens=8192`
- `get_usage_summary()` **(v2.2: reads from DB):** returns lifetime totals (calls, input tokens, output tokens) from persistent storage, not ephemeral session data

### `tools/sandbox.py` - Code Execution (v2 + v6.2 + v6.3 + v6.4 + v6.5 + v6.6: shell mode, traceback extraction, expanded safety, Docker isolation, process group kill, code scanner)
- `ExecutionResult` dataclass: `success`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `traceback` (v2), `files_created`, `timed_out`, `return_code`, `auto_installed` (v6.3)
- **Command blocklist (v6.6+, 39 patterns):** `_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` checks all commands before execution. Patterns include: `rm -rf` (root/home/critical dirs), `mkfs`, `dd if=`, `shutdown/reboot/halt/poweroff`, `fork bomb`, `sudo`, `curl|sh`, `curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `wget|bash`, `chmod 777/a+rwx`, interpreter inline execution (`python -c`, `perl -e`, `ruby -e`, `node -e`), destructive find (`-delete`, `-exec rm`), base64 decode piped to shell, home directory relocation (`mv ~/`), dotfile write/append redirects (`.bashrc`, `.ssh`, `.gitconfig`, etc.), symlink attacks on dotfiles, printf/echo piped to shell, eval with command substitution, bash/sh -c string splitting. Blocked commands return failure with security warning.
- **Code content scanner (v6.6):** `_check_code_safety()` scans Python code content before subprocess execution. Blocks credential file reads (`~/.ssh/`, `~/.gnupg/`, `.env`, PEM, id_rsa), `os.system()`, `shutil.rmtree(~/root)`, raw socket connections, `/etc/passwd|shadow` reads. Not applied in Docker mode. Defense-in-depth, not a security boundary.
- **Audit logging (v6.6, 12 patterns):** `_LOGGED_PATTERNS` records file deletion, permission changes, git push, service management, network downloads, pip install from URL, find commands, symlink operations, file moves, python inline execution, eval commands, and printf pipes for review.
- **`_filter_env()` (v6.3):** shared helper that builds a safe subprocess environment by stripping exact-match keys (`PROTECTED_ENV_KEYS`) and pattern-match keys (vars containing KEY, TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, CREDENTIAL via `PROTECTED_ENV_SUBSTRINGS`). Used by both `run_code()` and `run_shell()`.
- `run_code()`: writes code to temp file in working directory, executes via `subprocess.Popen()` with `start_new_session=True` for process group isolation, supports Python (`python3 -u`), JavaScript (`node`), and Bash (`bash -e`); on timeout, kills the entire process group via `os.killpg()` to prevent orphaned child processes; detects newly created files by diffing directory contents before/after; cleans up temp script in `finally` block
- `run_code_with_auto_install()` (v6.3): wraps `run_code()` with automatic `pip install` on ImportError/ModuleNotFoundError. Parses missing module name via `_parse_import_error()`, maps common import-name mismatches (PIL→Pillow, cv2→opencv-python, etc. via `_PIP_NAME_MAP`), retries up to `max_install_retries` times. Docker-aware: uses `_docker_pip_install()` when Docker is enabled.
- **Docker isolation (v6.4):** When `DOCKER_ENABLED=true`, `run_code()` routes to `_run_code_docker()` which executes inside disposable containers. `_docker_available()` checks Docker daemon + sandbox image with 60s caching and Docker socket fast-fail (checks `/var/run/docker.sock` before spawning subprocess). `_build_docker_cmd()` constructs the `docker run` command with volume mounts, resource limits, and `--user {uid}:{gid}`. `_docker_pip_install()` installs packages into a persistent cache volume, serialized via `threading.Lock` (`_docker_pip_lock`) to prevent corruption under concurrency. Named containers with explicit `docker kill` on timeout prevent orphaned processes.
- `run_shell()` (v2): executes shell commands for project invocations; supports venv activation (prepends `source <venv>/bin/activate` to command), custom working directories, custom environment variables; builds full command with `&&` chaining; uses `start_new_session=True` with process group kill on timeout (v6.5); also detects new files and extracts tracebacks
- `_extract_traceback()` (v2): parses stderr to find the last "Traceback (most recent call last):" block and returns everything from there to the end -- provides exact file names, line numbers, and exception messages to the retry loop
- stdout capped at 50K chars, stderr at 20K chars to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Server management (v8.2):** Thread-safe server registry with `start_server()`, `stop_server()`, `stop_all_servers()`, `list_servers()`. Port allocation from configurable range (8100-8120), HTTP polling for readiness, auto-kill timer via `threading.Timer`. Executor auto-starts `python3 -m http.server` for frontend/ui_design tasks after HTML generation.

### `tools/projects.py` - Project Registry (v2)
- `load_projects()`: reads `projects.yaml` via `yaml.safe_load()`, caches in module-level `_projects` list
- `get_projects()`: returns cached list, auto-loads if empty
- `match_project()`: iterates all projects' trigger keywords (case-insensitive substring match), scores by trigger length (longer = more specific), returns best match or `None`
- `get_project_context()`: formats a project's full info as text for Claude prompts -- includes name, path, description, available commands, requires_file flag, and timeout
- `get_all_projects_summary()`: one-line summary of each project with first 3 triggers, used in classifier's system prompt

### `tools/model_router.py` - Model Router (v8.0.0)
- Routes LLM calls to Claude or Ollama based on purpose, complexity, RAM availability, and daily budget
- `route_and_call()` is the main entry point — drop-in replacement for `claude_client.call()` with routing intelligence
- Routing rules: audit → always Opus, code_gen → always Sonnet, low-complexity classify/plan → Ollama if available
- Budget escalation: if daily spend exceeds 70% of `DAILY_BUDGET_USD`, routes classify/plan to Ollama regardless of complexity
- `_get_today_spend()` queries `api_usage` table for today's total cost (UTC midnight cutoff)
- Ollama fallback: if Ollama call fails, transparently falls back to Claude Sonnet with a warning log
- `_ollama_available()` checks Ollama API with 2-second timeout; `_ram_below_threshold()` uses psutil

### `tools/deployer.py` - Static Deployment (v8.1 + v8.4)
- Module for deploying generated frontend artifacts to live URLs
- `deploy(output_dir, project_name)`: main entry point — routes to provider-specific function based on `config.DEPLOY_PROVIDER`
- **GitHub Pages (v8.1):** `_deploy_github_pages()` — uses `gh` CLI to push to a dedicated repo's branch. Requires `DEPLOY_REPO` and `DEPLOY_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Vercel (v8.1):** `_deploy_vercel()` — uses `vercel` CLI with `--prod` flag and `--token`. Requires `DEPLOY_VERCEL_TOKEN`.
- **Firebase Hosting (v8.4):** `_deploy_firebase()` — creates a temporary `firebase.json` hosting config, runs `firebase deploy --only hosting` with `--token`. Uses `try/finally` to clean up `firebase.json` after deployment. Requires `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_PROJECT` and `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN`.
- All providers: validate required credentials, raise `ValueError` on missing config, return the deployed URL
- Credential safety: `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN` is stripped from subprocess env via `PROTECTED_ENV_SUBSTRINGS` containing "TOKEN"

### `tools/visual_check.py` - Playwright Visual Verification (v8.3)
- `VisualCheckResult` dataclass: `checked`, `loads`, `status_code`, `console_errors`, `screenshot_path`, `error`
- `check_page(url, screenshot_dir, timeout)`: launches headless Chromium via Playwright, navigates to URL, captures console errors via callback, takes full-page screenshot, returns structured result
- **Graceful degradation:** imports `playwright.sync_api` inside the function — if Playwright is not installed, returns `VisualCheckResult(checked=False)` with no crash
- Handles `TimeoutError` and general exceptions, always returns a result (never raises)
- Used by `auditor.py` to inject visual context into the Opus audit prompt

### `tools/file_manager.py` - File Operations
- `save_upload()`: validates against `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`, saves bytes to uploads dir with UUID-based unique filenames (`{stem}_{uuid4_hex8}{suffix}`) to prevent TOCTOU race conditions (v6.7)
- `get_file_content()`: reads text files with UTF-8 encoding (errors="replace"), truncates at `max_chars` (default 50K), returns binary file description for non-text files
- `list_outputs()`: lists files in outputs directory
- `clean_outputs()`: deletes all files in outputs directory
- `ensure_project_dir()`: creates named subdirectory under `workspace/projects/`

### `storage/db.py` - SQLite Persistence
- `init_db()`: creates `tasks` table with 11 columns if not exists. **v6.2:** enables `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` for concurrent write safety.
- Schema: `id` (TEXT PK), `user_id` (INTEGER), `message` (TEXT), `task_type` (TEXT), `status` (TEXT, default "pending"), `plan` (TEXT), `result` (TEXT), `error` (TEXT), `token_usage` (TEXT/JSON), `created_at` (TEXT/ISO), `completed_at` (TEXT/ISO)
- `create_task()`: inserts new record with UTC timestamp
- `update_task()`: whitelist-based field update (only accepts known field names, prevents injection)
- `get_task()`: fetch single task by ID using `aiosqlite.Row` factory
- `list_tasks()`: recent tasks for a user, ordered by `created_at DESC`, default limit 10
- **`prune_old_data()` (v6.2):** async function that deletes conversation_history > 30 days and api_usage > 90 days
- **`cleanup_workspace_files()` (v6.2):** sync function that removes output and upload files older than 7 days
- Each function opens and closes its own connection (acceptable for SQLite, avoids connection sharing across async contexts)

### `scheduler/cron.py` - Task Scheduling (v2: SQLite-backed persistence)
- `AsyncIOScheduler` with `SQLAlchemyJobStore` backed by a **separate** SQLite database (`storage/scheduler.db`) to avoid lock contention with the main aiosqlite database (`storage/agentsutra.db`) -- scheduled tasks survive process restarts and reboots
- `start_scheduler()`: starts scheduler, logs count of persisted jobs loaded from DB
- `stop_scheduler()`: graceful shutdown with `wait=False`
- `add_interval_job()`: adds recurring job at fixed interval (hours and/or minutes), supports `replace_existing=True`
- `list_jobs()`: returns list of dicts with `id`, `next_run`, `name` for all scheduled jobs
- `remove_job()`: accepts partial ID prefix (user only sees first 8 chars from `/schedule` output), iterates jobs to find prefix match

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (`python3 --version`), 3.11 recommended
- pip (`pip3 --version`)
- A Telegram account
- An Anthropic API key with access to Claude Sonnet and Opus models

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

1. **Anthropic API key**
   - Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Sign up or log in
   - Navigate to Settings --> API Keys
   - Create a new key, copy it (starts with `sk-ant-`)

2. **Telegram Bot Token**
   - Open Telegram, search for `@BotFather`
   - Send `/newbot`
   - Choose a name (e.g., "AgentSutra") and username (e.g., "agentsutra_bot")
   - Copy the token BotFather gives you

3. **Your Telegram User ID**
   - Open Telegram, search for `@userinfobot`
   - Send any message
   - It replies with your numeric user ID (e.g., `123456789`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/AgentSutra
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual values:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=your_user_id_here
DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
COMPLEX_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6
EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=60
MAX_RETRIES=3
API_MAX_RETRIES=5
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50
```

#### Budget Controls (Optional but Recommended)

Add daily and/or monthly API spend limits to `.env` to prevent runaway costs:
```
DAILY_BUDGET_USD=5       # Max $5/day on API calls
MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD=50    # Max $50/month on API calls
```

When a limit is hit, all API calls are rejected and tasks fail with a clear budget-exceeded message. The bot remains responsive — you can still use `/cost` to check spend and `/health` for status. Set to `0` (default) for unlimited spend.

Check your current spend anytime with the `/cost` command in Telegram, which shows today's spend, this month's spend, and all-time totals broken down by model.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Edit projects.yaml

Update all `path:` values to match your machine's directory structure. Each path must be absolute:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: "My Project"
    path: "/absolute/path/to/project"
    description: |
      What it does. Claude reads this.
    commands:
      run: "python3 main.py"
    timeout: 300
    requires_file: false
    triggers:
      - "keyword"
```

If you have no external projects to register, you can leave the file with an empty list:
```yaml
projects: []
```

### Step 5: Start

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Expected startup output:
```
AgentSutra starting up
Allowed user IDs: [123456789]
Default model: claude-sonnet-4-6
Workspace: /Users/you/Desktop/AgentSutra/workspace
Database initialized at /Users/you/Desktop/AgentSutra/storage/agentsutra.db
Projects registered: 8
Telegram bot configured with 19 command handlers
Scheduler started (0 persisted jobs loaded)
Starting Telegram bot (polling mode)...
Send /start to your bot to begin
```

### Step 6: Docker Sandbox (Optional)

For isolated code execution (prevents LLM-generated code from accessing host filesystem):

1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
2. Launch Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully start
3. Build the sandbox image:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build_sandbox.sh
./scripts/build_sandbox.sh
```
4. Enable in `.env`:
```
DOCKER_ENABLED=true
```
5. Optional configuration:
```
DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT=2g     # Max memory per container
DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT=2          # Max CPU cores per container
DOCKER_NETWORK=bridge       # "bridge" (allow network) or "none" (airgapped)
```

Without Docker, code executes via subprocess with full user-level access (protected only by the regex blocklist and Opus auditor).

### Step 7: Test

Open Telegram, find your bot, and send `/start`. Then try:
- `Write a Python function that checks if a number is prime` (code task)
- Send a CSV file, then type `Analyze this data and create a chart` (data task)
- `Run the job scraper` (project invocation)
- `/projects` to see all registered projects
- `/schedule 360 Run the job scraper and send results` (scheduled task)

## Transfer to agentruntime1

### Preparation (on current machine)

```bash
# Remove temp files and caches
rm -rf workspace/uploads/* workspace/outputs/*
rm -f storage/agentsutra.db
rm -f agentsutra.log
rm -rf __pycache__ **/__pycache__
```

Do NOT copy `.env` (contains secrets) or `venv/` (platform-specific binaries).

### Transfer

```bash
# Option A: rsync (if SSH or shared filesystem between profiles)
rsync -av --exclude='venv' --exclude='.env' --exclude='__pycache__' \
  --exclude='*.pyc' --exclude='agentsutra.db' --exclude='agentsutra.log' \
  ~/Desktop/AgentSutra/ /Users/<runtime-user>/AgentSutra/

# Option B: Manual copy
# Copy the AgentSutra folder to agentruntime1's home directory
# Exclude: venv/, .env, __pycache__/, *.pyc, agentsutra.db, agentsutra.log
```

### Update paths in projects.yaml

Every `path:` in `projects.yaml` is an absolute path. After transfer, update them all to match the runtime user's filesystem:

```yaml
# Before (dev machine):
- path: "/Users/dev/Desktop/projects/my_scraper"

# After (runtime machine):
- path: "/Users/runtime/projects/my_scraper"
```

See `projects.yaml.example` for detailed examples. If projects are not transferred, remove those entries or update their paths.

### Setup on Runtime User

```bash
# 1. Switch to agentruntime1 profile and open terminal

# 2. Navigate to the project
cd ~/AgentSutra

# 3. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Create .env with your real keys
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS

# 6. Update projects.yaml paths (see above)
nano projects.yaml

# 7. Test
python main.py
```

### Auto-start on Boot (launchd plist)

Create the launch agent directory and plist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentsutra.bot.plist`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.agentsutra.bot</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/youruser/AgentSutra/venv/bin/python</string>
        <string>/Users/youruser/AgentSutra/main.py</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/youruser/AgentSutra</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/youruser/AgentSutra/launchd_stdout.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/youruser/AgentSutra/launchd_stderr.log</string>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load and manage:
```bash
# Load (start now + on boot)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentsutra.bot.plist

# Check if running
launchctl list | grep agentsutra

# Stop
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentsutra.bot.plist

# View logs
tail -f ~/AgentSutra/agentsutra.log
tail -f ~/AgentSutra/launchd_stderr.log
```

**Important:** The plist uses the venv Python directly (`venv/bin/python`), so no activation script is needed. The `WorkingDirectory` ensures `config.py` finds `.env` via `Path(__file__).parent`. `KeepAlive` restarts the process if it crashes. Scheduled tasks survive reboots because APScheduler's job store is SQLite-backed.

### Monthly Maintenance (launchd cron)

AgentSutra auto-prunes conversation history (30 days) and API usage records (90 days) on every startup, and the `RotatingFileHandler` caps log files at 10MB. However, two resources grow silently over months of continuous operation:

- **SQLite fragmentation**: Deleted rows leave free pages inside the database file. `VACUUM` reclaims this space.
- **Docker pip cache**: Auto-installed packages accumulate in `workspace/.pip-cache/`. Rarely large, but stale packages waste disk.
- **Docker dangling images**: Failed or interrupted image builds leave orphaned layers.

Create `~/AgentSutra/scripts/monthly_maintenance.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# AgentSutra monthly maintenance — reclaim disk space
set -e

AGENTSUTRA_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
echo "[$(date)] AgentSutra monthly maintenance starting"

# 1. VACUUM SQLite databases (reclaim free pages)
for db in "$AGENTSUTRA_DIR/storage/agentsutra.db" "$AGENTSUTRA_DIR/storage/scheduler.db"; do
    if [ -f "$db" ]; then
        echo "  VACUUM $db (before: $(du -h "$db" | cut -f1))"
        sqlite3 "$db" "VACUUM;"
        echo "  VACUUM $db (after:  $(du -h "$db" | cut -f1))"
    fi
done

# 2. Clean Docker pip cache (remove packages not accessed in 30+ days)
PIP_CACHE="$AGENTSUTRA_DIR/workspace/.pip-cache"
if [ -d "$PIP_CACHE" ]; then
    SIZE_BEFORE=$(du -sh "$PIP_CACHE" | cut -f1)
    find "$PIP_CACHE" -type f -atime +30 -delete 2>/dev/null || true
    find "$PIP_CACHE" -type d -empty -delete 2>/dev/null || true
    SIZE_AFTER=$(du -sh "$PIP_CACHE" | cut -f1)
    echo "  pip-cache cleaned ($SIZE_BEFORE -> $SIZE_AFTER)"
fi

# 3. Docker system prune (dangling images, stopped containers, build cache)
if command -v docker &>/dev/null && docker info &>/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "  Docker prune:"
    docker system prune -f --filter "until=720h"
fi

echo "[$(date)] Monthly maintenance complete"
```

```bash
chmod +x ~/AgentSutra/scripts/monthly_maintenance.sh
```

Auto-schedule via launchd — create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentsutra.maintenance.plist`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

## How the Pipeline Works

### Overview

Every task (text message, file+instruction, or scheduled job) runs through the same 5-stage LangGraph pipeline. The pipeline is synchronous internally but offloaded to a thread via `asyncio.to_thread()`. Each stage is wrapped to update a thread-safe stage tracker, enabling real-time streaming status to Telegram.

```
classify --> plan --> execute --> audit --+--> deliver
                ^                        |
                +--- retry (fail) -------+
```

### Stage 1: Classify

**File:** `brain/nodes/classifier.py`
**Claude calls:** 0 (project match) or 1 (Claude classification, max 200 tokens)
**Model:** DEFAULT_MODEL (Sonnet)

Two classification paths:

1. **Fast path (v2):** `match_project()` checks the user's message against all project trigger keywords. Case-insensitive substring matching, scored by trigger length (longer matches = more specific). If a project matches, returns immediately with `task_type: "project"` and the full project config -- no API call needed.

2. **Slow path:** Sends the message to Claude with a system prompt listing all 5 categories and a summary of all registered projects. Claude returns JSON `{"task_type": "...", "reason": "..."}`. Falls back to keyword scanning if JSON parsing fails.

Categories (7 task types):
- `project` -- matches a registered project (invoke existing code)
- `code` -- write new scripts, apps, websites, APIs, bug fixes
- `data` -- CSV/Excel analysis, charts, summaries
- `file` -- file conversion, transformation, reformatting
- `automation` -- web scraping, scheduled reports, monitoring
- `ui_design` -- visual design mockups, UI components
- `frontend` -- production web apps, HTML/CSS/JS frontends

### Stage 2: Plan

**File:** `brain/nodes/planner.py`
**Claude calls:** 1 (max 3000 tokens)
**Model:** DEFAULT_MODEL (Sonnet)

Creates a step-by-step execution plan using a task-type-specific system prompt:

- **Project mode (v2):** Uses PROJECT_SYSTEM prompt with full project context (name, path, description, available commands). Instructs Claude to use EXISTING commands, not write new code. Plan specifies which commands to run, in what order, with what parameters.

- **Code/Data/File/Automation mode:** Uses specialized system prompts (CODE_SYSTEM, DATA_SYSTEM, FILE_SYSTEM, AUTOMATION_SYSTEM). Each includes the TDD_INSTRUCTION (v2) that mandates `assert` statements for self-verification.

On retry: the previous audit feedback and execution output (up to 3K chars) are appended to the prompt with "PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED" header, requesting specific fixes.

### Stage 3: Execute

**File:** `brain/nodes/executor.py`
**Claude calls:** 1 (max 2000 for shell scripts, max 8192 for code)
**Model:** DEFAULT_MODEL (Sonnet)

Two execution paths:

**Project execution (v2):**
1. Claude generates a bash script from the plan using SHELL_GEN_SYSTEM prompt
2. Script is passed to `run_shell()` via heredoc with a randomized delimiter (`AGENTSUTRA_EOF_<uuid>`) to prevent collision with generated code
3. Runs in the project's working directory with optional venv activation
4. Uses the project's configured timeout (can be up to 900s for long-running scrapers)

**Code execution:**
1. Claude generates Python/JS code from the plan
2. Markdown code blocks stripped via regex
3. Code written to temp file and executed via `subprocess.run()` in `workspace/outputs/`
4. Default 60s timeout

Both paths:
- Capture stdout (max 50K chars) and stderr (max 20K chars)
- Detect newly created files by directory diffing
- Extract full Python tracebacks from stderr (v2) -- exact file names and line numbers are preserved for the retry loop
- Return `ExecutionResult` dataclass with all fields

### Stage 4: Audit

**File:** `brain/nodes/auditor.py`
**Claude calls:** 1 (max 800 tokens)
**Model:** COMPLEX_MODEL (Opus) -- deliberately different from executor's model (v2)

Cross-model adversarial review (v2): The auditor runs on Opus while the executor runs on Sonnet. This prevents the "echo chamber" effect where the same model would approve its own flawed output. A different model is more likely to catch subtle errors.

Strict evaluation:
1. Does the output actually accomplish the task? (not just "runs without errors")
2. Did execution succeed (exit code 0)?
3. Did all TDD assertions pass? (looks for "ALL ASSERTIONS PASSED")
4. Any tracebacks or errors in stderr?
5. For projects: did the command actually produce expected output?
6. Is output complete, not truncated?
7. **Visual verification (v8.3):** For frontend/ui_design tasks with a `server_url`, runs Playwright headless check and appends results (page loads, HTTP status, console errors) to the audit prompt before Opus review

Returns JSON verdict:
- `"pass"` --> route to deliver
- `"fail"` --> increment retry_count, route back to plan (up to MAX_RETRIES times)

The feedback field contains specific, actionable fix instructions that get injected into the planner's next prompt along with the full traceback (v2).

### Stage 5: Deliver

**File:** `brain/nodes/deliverer.py`
**Claude calls:** 1 (max 800 tokens, temperature=0.3)
**Model:** DEFAULT_MODEL (Sonnet)

Generates a polished Telegram-ready summary via Claude:
- Receives original request, execution output, code description, and artifact list
- Claude produces a concise, structured summary (under 1800 chars for Telegram)
- Falls back to template-based formatting if Claude call fails
- Saves generated code as `.py` file artifact for attachment
- Appends file list at the bottom if not already mentioned in summary
- **Cross-task memory (v8.0):** extracts success/failure patterns and stores in `project_memory` for future planner injection
- **Auto-deployment (v8.1):** for frontend/ui_design tasks that pass audit, deploys artifacts to configured provider and stores `deploy_url` in state
- **Screenshot attachment (v8.3):** attaches Playwright `preview.png` to artifacts when visual check was enabled
- **Debug sidecar (v8.0):** builds per-task debug JSON with timings, verdict, retries, server_url, deploy_url

### Pipeline Cost Summary

| Scenario | Claude Calls | Models Used |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Project task (trigger match, no retry) | 4 | Sonnet (plan, execute, deliver) + Opus (audit) |
| Project task (Claude classification, no retry) | 5 | Sonnet (classify, plan, execute, deliver) + Opus (audit) |
| Code task (no retry) | 5 | Sonnet (classify, plan, execute, deliver) + Opus (audit) |
| Any task with 1 retry | +3 | Sonnet (plan, execute) + Opus (audit) per retry |
| Any task with max retries (3) | up to 14 | Sonnet + Opus per iteration, Sonnet deliver at end |
| Frontend task with deploy | +0 (no extra Claude calls) | Deploy uses CLI subprocess, not LLM |

## Telegram Bot Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/start` | Welcome message with capabilities list and all available commands | `/start` |
| `/status` | Shows active tasks; `/status <id>` shows partial pipeline state: plan, audit, timings (v8.6) | `/status` or `/status a1b2` |
| `/history` | Last 5 tasks with status indicators (done/err/stop/...) | `/history` |

### /schedule Subcommands

```
/schedule                          Show usage help
/schedule <minutes> <task>         Schedule a recurring task
/schedule list                     Show all scheduled tasks with next run time
/schedule remove <id>              Remove a scheduled task by ID (first 8 chars)
```

Examples:
```
/schedule 360 Run the job scraper and send results
/schedule 1440 Run the intelligence pipeline and send briefing
/schedule list
/schedule remove a1b2c3d4
```

When a scheduled task fires, it runs the full pipeline and sends the result (text + files) to the originating chat, prefixed with `[Scheduled]`.

### Non-Command Interactions

| Interaction | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Any text message | Treated as a task prompt, runs the full agent pipeline |
| File upload (document) | Saved to `workspace/uploads/`, bot replies "File received, now send instructions" |
| Photo upload | Saved as `photo_<uuid>.jpg` to uploads, bot replies "Photo received, send instructions" |

### Streaming Status (v2)

When a task is running, the bot edits its initial status message in real time as the pipeline progresses:

```
Starting... (task a1b2c3d4)
Classifying task... (task a1b2c3d4)
Creating execution plan... (task a1b2c3d4)
Generating and running code... (task a1b2c3d4)
Auditing output quality... (task a1b2c3d4)
Preparing response... (task a1b2c3d4)
Completed. (task a1b2c3d4)
```

Status is polled every 3 seconds from the thread-safe stage tracker in `brain/graph.py`.

## Project Registry Guide

### What It Is

The project registry is what makes AgentSutra more than a code-generating chatbot. By registering your existing projects in `projects.yaml`, the agent becomes a CLI co-pilot for your actual codebases — it matches natural language requests to your real tools and runs them with the right parameters.

**Without project registration:** You say "scrape jobs" and the agent writes a generic scraping script from scratch.
**With project registration:** You say "scrape jobs" and the agent runs your actual scraper (`python3 -m scraper scrape --all --workers 5`) in its real directory with its real venv — no code generation needed.

The registry file (`projects.yaml`) tells AgentSutra about your existing codebases. Instead of generating new code from scratch, the agent matches trigger keywords in your message, then generates and executes the appropriate shell commands in your project's directory.

### File Format

```yaml
projects:

  - name: "Human-Readable Project Name"
    path: "/absolute/path/to/project/root"
    description: |
      Multi-line description of what the project does.
      Claude reads this verbatim to understand the project.
      Include: what it does, what input it expects, what output it produces,
      how to run it.
    commands:
      command_name: "shell command to run"
      another_cmd: "python3 script.py --flag {placeholder}"
    timeout: 300
    requires_file: false
    triggers:
      - "keyword phrase"
      - "another trigger"
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name shown in `/projects` and delivery messages |
| `path` | string | Yes | Absolute path to project root. Must exist on disk. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Multi-line description. Claude reads this to understand the project. Be detailed. |
| `commands` | dict | Yes | Named shell commands. Keys are names, values are shell strings. Use `{placeholder}` for parameters. |
| `timeout` | int | No | Max execution time in seconds. Default: 60. Set higher for long-running tasks. |
| `requires_file` | bool | No | If true, the agent knows a file upload is needed. Default: false. |
| `triggers` | list | Yes | Case-insensitive keyword phrases for matching. Longer phrases match with higher priority. |

### Trigger Matching

When you send a message, the classifier checks it against all project triggers before calling Claude:

1. For each project, check if any trigger is a substring of your message (case-insensitive)
2. Score each match by the trigger's character length (longer = more specific = higher priority)
3. Return the project with the highest score, or `None` if no triggers match
4. If no trigger matches, fall back to Claude classification (which also knows about projects)

Example: if you send "Run the job scraper for affiliate jobs", the triggers "job scraper" (len 11) and "affiliate jobs" (len 14) both match the Affiliate Job Scraper project. The longer trigger wins.

### Commands Format

Commands are shell strings executed in the project's directory via `run_shell()`:

```yaml
commands:
  scrape: "python3 -m scraper scrape --all --workers 5"
  export: "python3 -m scraper export"
  full: "python3 -m scraper scrape --all && python3 -m scraper export"
```

Placeholder syntax: use `{name}` for parameters the agent fills in:
```yaml
commands:
  scrape_one: "python3 -m scraper scrape --slug {slug}"
  clean: "python3 -m aj_clean --input {file}"
```

Claude generates the actual command by reading the plan and filling in placeholders based on the user's message and any uploaded files.

### Adding a New Project

**Step 1: Start from the example template**

If you don't have a `projects.yaml` yet, copy the included example:
```bash
cp projects.yaml.example projects.yaml
```

The example file contains 3 fully documented project templates (scraper, data pipeline, full-stack app) you can modify.

**Step 2: Add your project entry**

Open `projects.yaml` and add a new entry under `projects:`:

```yaml
  - name: "My Data Pipeline"
    path: "/Users/you/projects/data-pipeline"   # Must be absolute, must exist
    description: |
      Processes raw CSV uploads through deduplication, normalisation,
      and classification. Input: Excel file. Output: cleaned CSV + report.
      Run with: python3 -m pipeline --input <file>
    commands:
      clean: "python3 -m pipeline --input {file}"    # {file} = filled from user upload
      stats: "python3 -m pipeline --stats"
    timeout: 300                                      # 5 minutes max
    requires_file: true                               # Needs a file upload to work
    venv: "/Users/you/projects/data-pipeline/venv"   # Optional: Python venv path
    triggers:
      - "clean data"
      - "data pipeline"
      - "process data"
```

**Step 3: Write good triggers**

Triggers are case-insensitive substring matches against your message. Tips:
- Use 3-6 triggers per project — enough to catch natural variations
- Make them specific enough to avoid false matches across projects
- Longer triggers have higher priority (e.g., "affiliate job scraper" beats "job")
- Test by sending a message to the bot and checking if it classifies as `project`

**Step 4: Restart and test**

The registry is loaded at startup, so restart AgentSutra:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Then send a message matching one of your triggers. Use `/projects` to verify all projects loaded correctly.

### Current Projects (8)

## Extending AgentSutra

AgentSutra is a working system, not a framework — but it's built so you can extend it without fighting the architecture. Below are the most common extension points with concrete steps.

### Adding a New Task Type

Every task type flows through the same 5-stage pipeline, so adding a new type means teaching each stage about it.

**Files to modify:**
1. `brain/nodes/classifier.py` — Add the type name to the classification prompt and `_FALLBACK_ORDER`
2. `brain/nodes/planner.py` — Add a task-specific system prompt (e.g., `TESTING_SYSTEM`) with domain-relevant instructions
3. `brain/nodes/auditor.py` — Add an entry to `AUDIT_CRITERIA` dict with pass/fail rules specific to the type
4. `brain/nodes/executor.py` — (Optional) Add specialized execution logic if the type needs something beyond `run_code()`/`run_shell()`

**Example:** Adding a "testing" type that generates and runs test suites:
- Classifier recognizes "write tests for", "test this function"
- Planner prompt instructs Claude to use pytest conventions and assert coverage
- Auditor checks that all tests pass and coverage meets a threshold
- Executor uses the existing `run_code()` — no changes needed

### Adding a New Bot Command

**Files to modify:**
1. `bot/handlers.py` — Write an async handler function decorated with `@auth_required`
2. `bot/telegram_bot.py` — Register it in `create_bot()` with `app.add_handler(CommandHandler("yourcommand", cmd_yourcommand))`
3. Update the `/help` output in `cmd_start` to list the new command

**Example:** Adding a `/stats` command:
```python
# In bot/handlers.py
@auth_required
async def cmd_stats(update, context):
    # Gather metrics, format response
    await update.message.reply_text(stats_text)
```

### Customizing Sandbox Security Rules

The command blocklist and code scanner are regex-based and easy to extend.

**Files to modify:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — `_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` (shell command blocklist), `_DANGEROUS_CODE_PATTERNS` (Python code scanner), `_LOGGED_PATTERNS` (audit-only logging)

**To block a new command pattern:** Add a tuple `(compiled_regex, "Human-readable reason")` to `_BLOCKED_PATTERNS`. The command is rejected before execution with the reason shown to the user.

**To allow something currently blocked:** Remove the pattern — but understand why it was blocked first. Most patterns prevent accidental destructive operations from LLM hallucination.

### Integrating External Services

AgentSutra's `tools/` directory is the natural home for new integrations. Each tool module exposes functions that pipeline nodes can call.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new module in `tools/` (e.g., `tools/slack_notifier.py`)
2. Import and call it from the relevant pipeline node (usually `executor.py` or `deliverer.py`)
3. Add any required config vars to `config.py` and `.env.example`

**Examples:** Slack notifications on task completion, database connections for direct SQL queries, webhook triggers for CI/CD pipelines.

### Scheduled Tasks

Set up recurring automation directly from Telegram:

```
/schedule 360 Run the job scraper          # Every 6 hours
/schedule 1440 Send me the daily briefing  # Every 24 hours
/schedule 60 Check if example.com is up    # Every hour
```

Jobs are stored in SQLite and survive reboots. Manage with `/schedule list` (see all jobs) and `/schedule remove <id>` (cancel a job). Each scheduled run goes through the full pipeline — classify, plan, execute, audit, deliver — so it gets the same quality checks as interactive tasks.

### Using Local AI Models (Ollama)

For cost-sensitive tasks, privacy-sensitive data, or offline operation, AgentSutra can use locally running Ollama models.

**Setup:**
1. Install Ollama: `brew install ollama` (macOS) or see [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
3. Configure in `.env`:
   ```
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
   OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
   ```

**When to use:** Batch classification of hundreds of rows (avoids API costs), processing confidential data that shouldn't leave your machine, or when your internet is down.

The agent can also decide to use Ollama autonomously — for example, using local AI for bulk classification while using Claude for the planning and auditing stages.

---

## Swapping Model Providers

AgentSutra is built on Claude, but the architecture is designed so that swapping to another provider (Gemini, GPT, open-source) requires changes in **exactly 1 file**: `tools/claude_client.py`.

### How It Works Today

The entire codebase interacts with LLMs through one function:

```python
# tools/claude_client.py
def call(prompt, system_prompt="", model=None, ...) -> str:
```

Every node in the pipeline (classifier, planner, executor, auditor, deliverer) calls `claude_client.call()`. None of them import `anthropic` directly or know which provider is being used.

### To Swap to Another Provider

**Step 1:** Replace the API call in `tools/claude_client.py`

The `call()` function (around line 180) currently does:

```python
response = self.client.messages.create(
    model=model,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    ...
)
```

Replace this with your provider's equivalent. For example, with OpenAI:

```python
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
    ],
)
```

**Step 2:** Update the cost tracking

The `MODEL_COSTS` dict and `_persist_usage()` function handle per-token cost calculation. Update the pricing to match your provider.

**Step 3:** Update `.env`

Change `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your provider's key name, and update `DEFAULT_MODEL` / `COMPLEX_MODEL` to your models.

### What About Extended Thinking?

Extended thinking (Anthropic-specific) is handled in `call()` with a feature flag (`ENABLE_THINKING`). If your provider doesn't support it, set `ENABLE_THINKING=false` in `.env` and the code skips it entirely.

### Why Not an Abstraction Layer?

We deliberately chose not to build a provider abstraction (like LiteLLM or a custom interface). The reasoning:

1. **One file to change vs. an abstraction to maintain.** Swapping providers is a one-time migration, not a runtime toggle. An abstraction adds permanent complexity for a hypothetical event.
2. **Provider-specific features matter.** Extended thinking, prompt caching, and tool use work differently across providers. An abstraction layer either exposes the lowest common denominator or becomes a leaky abstraction.
3. **The 5-node pipeline doesn't care.** Nodes call `client.call(prompt, system_prompt)` and get a string back. That interface is already provider-agnostic.

### Multi-Provider Setup (Auditor on a Different Provider)

The adversarial auditing pattern works best when the auditor uses a different model family. You could:
1. Create a second client instance in `claude_client.py` for the auditor
2. Have `auditor.py` use the second client
3. This gives you, e.g., Claude for execution + Gemini for auditing

This requires ~30 lines of code changes across 2 files.

---

## Security Model

### Authentication
- **Telegram user ID allowlist:** Only IDs in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` can interact with the bot
- **Per-handler enforcement:** Every command and message handler is wrapped with `@auth_required`
- **Unauthorized users:** Receive "Unauthorized. Your user ID is not in the allow list." and their attempt is logged
- **Multiple users supported:** Comma-separated IDs in `.env`

### Code Execution
- Generated code runs in `subprocess.run()` with hard timeout (default 60s, configurable)
- Working directory for generated code is restricted to `workspace/outputs/`
- Project commands run in their own directories with configurable timeout (up to 900s)
- stdout capped at 50K chars, stderr at 20K chars to prevent memory exhaustion
- Temp scripts are deleted in `finally` blocks
- **Docker isolation (v6.4, optional):** When `DOCKER_ENABLED=true`, `run_code()` executes LLM-generated code inside Docker containers. Only `workspace/outputs/` (read-write) and `workspace/uploads/` (read-only) are mounted. The host filesystem, SSH keys, `.env`, and all other files are completely inaccessible from inside the container. Resource limits (memory, CPU) and network mode (`bridge`/`none`) are configurable. Falls back to subprocess execution if Docker is unavailable. Without Docker, code has full user-level filesystem access — the regex blocklist and Opus auditor are the only barriers.
- **Network isolation advisory (v6.5):** Default `DOCKER_NETWORK=bridge` allows containers to access the internet (required for web scraping, API calls, `pip install`). For tasks processing sensitive internal data, set `DOCKER_NETWORK=none` to guarantee an airgapped execution environment where no network exfiltration is possible. This is a per-deployment risk decision — most tasks require `bridge`.

### Shell Execution (v2 + v6.2 + v6.3 + v6.6)
- `run_shell()` executes commands with `shell=True` -- necessary for venv activation and command chaining
- **Command blocklist (v6.6+, 39 patterns):** Before execution, commands are checked against 34 destructive patterns covering: filesystem destruction (`rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd`), system power (`shutdown`, `reboot`, `halt`, `poweroff`), privilege escalation (`sudo`), pipe-to-shell attacks (`curl|sh`, `wget|bash`, `printf|sh`, `echo|bash`), permission destruction (`chmod 777/a+rwx`), interpreter bypass (`python -c`, `perl -e`, `ruby -e`, `node -e`), destructive find (`-delete`, `-exec rm`), encoding bypass (`base64|bash`), home directory relocation (`mv ~/`), dotfile corruption (write/append redirects to `.bashrc`, `.ssh`, `.gitconfig`, etc.), symlink attacks on dotfiles, eval with command substitution, and bash/sh -c string splitting. Blocked commands are rejected with a security warning.
- **Code content scanner (v6.6):** In subprocess mode (non-Docker), Python code is scanned for dangerous operations before execution — credential file reads, `os.system()`, `shutil.rmtree()` on home/root, raw socket connections, and system file reads. Defense-in-depth, not a security boundary.
- **Audit logging (v6.6, 12 patterns):** file deletion, permission changes, git push, service management, network downloads, pip install from URL, find commands, symlink operations, file moves, python inline execution, eval commands, and printf pipes are logged for review even when allowed.
- **Environment filtering (v6.3):** `_filter_env()` strips credentials from subprocess environment using both exact-match keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) and pattern-based matching (any var containing KEY, TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, or CREDENTIAL in its name). Safe env vars (`PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, etc.) are preserved.
- **Parameter sanitization (v6.3):** `shlex.quote()` is applied to all project command placeholder values in executor.py, preventing command injection via parameter values (e.g., `; rm -rf ~/` becomes a literal string argument).
- Commands are generated by Claude based on project definitions -- the user does not inject raw shell
- Timeouts are enforced per project configuration

### Resource Guards (v6.2)
- **RAM guard:** New tasks are rejected when `psutil.virtual_memory().percent >= RAM_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` (default 90%). Applies to both interactive and scheduled tasks.
- **Concurrency cap:** Max `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` (default 3) simultaneous pipeline executions. Additional tasks are rejected with a clear message.
- **Rate limiter:** 5-second per-user cooldown between task submissions. Prevents accidental double-sends.
- **Budget enforcement:** `_check_budget()` runs before every Claude API call. Queries daily/monthly spend from `api_usage` table against configured limits. Raises `BudgetExceededError` if exceeded.

### Data Privacy
- All data stays on the Mac Mini -- no cloud storage
- SQLite database is local (`storage/agentsutra.db`)
- Workspace files (uploads, outputs) are local
- Scheduled job definitions persist in a separate SQLite database (`storage/scheduler.db`)
- Telegram messages transit through Telegram's servers (encrypted in transit)
- API prompts and task content are sent to Anthropic's servers (see their data retention policy)
- No telemetry, no analytics, no external logging

### Deployment Security (v8.1+)
- Deployment credentials (`DEPLOY_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_VERCEL_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN`) are loaded from `.env` and never logged
- `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN` is automatically stripped from subprocess environment via `PROTECTED_ENV_SUBSTRINGS` matching "TOKEN"
- Firebase deployment creates a temporary `firebase.json` config and cleans it up in a `try/finally` block
- All deployment providers validate required credentials before attempting any subprocess calls

### Secret Management
- API keys stored in `.env` file -- never committed to git
- `.env.example` provides template without real values
- Keys are loaded once at startup via `python-dotenv`
- No secrets appear in log output (keys are never logged)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot does not respond
1. Check `agentsutra.log` for errors
2. Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct in `.env`
3. Verify your Telegram user ID matches `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` (check with `@userinfobot`)
4. Make sure only one instance of the bot is running -- Telegram only allows one polling connection per token
5. If using launchd, check `launchd_stderr.log` for crash output

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"
- Check `.env` file exists in the AgentSutra root directory (same directory as `main.py`)
- Verify the key starts with `sk-ant-`
- No quotes around the value in `.env`
- No trailing whitespace

### "Projects registered: 0" but projects.yaml exists
- Check YAML syntax (indentation must be consistent)
- Verify `projects.yaml` is in the AgentSutra root directory
- Run `python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('projects.yaml')))"` to check for parse errors

### Project command fails with "Working directory does not exist"
- The `path:` in `projects.yaml` must be an absolute path that exists on disk
- After transferring to a new machine, update all paths
- Check: `ls /path/from/projects.yaml`

### Code execution timeout
- Default is 120 seconds; increase with `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=300` in `.env`
- For project commands, set the `timeout:` field in `projects.yaml` (e.g., `timeout: 900` for scrapers)
- Check if the generated code has an infinite loop

### Import errors on startup
- Make sure venv is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify Python version: `python3 --version` (need 3.10+, 3.11 recommended)

### Database errors
- Delete `storage/agentsutra.db` and restart -- it will be recreated (loses task history)
- Delete `storage/scheduler.db` and restart -- it will be recreated (loses scheduled job definitions)
- The two databases are separate to avoid lock contention between aiosqlite and SQLAlchemy

### Scheduler not firing
- Scheduler starts inside the bot's event loop via `post_init`
- Check logs for "Scheduler started (N persisted jobs loaded)"
- Scheduled jobs require the bot to be running -- if the bot was down when a job was due, it fires on next startup
- Use `/schedule list` to verify jobs are registered

### Streaming status not updating
- Stage updates are polled every 3 seconds; very fast tasks may complete before the first poll
- Telegram may rate-limit message edits if too frequent
- Check logs for stage transition messages

### Task stuck or no response
- Use `/status` to see current pipeline stage
- Use `/cancel` to abort and reset
- Check `agentsutra.log` for the task ID and any error tracebacks
- Claude API rate limits can cause delays (exponential backoff up to 8s)

### Scheduled task sends no result
- The scheduled callback needs a valid `chat_id`; it uses the chat where `/schedule` was called
- The scheduled function (`_scheduled_task_run`) is module-level with serializable args, so it survives APScheduler persistence and bot restarts correctly
- Check logs for `[Scheduled]` tagged entries

## External Validation

AgentSutra was independently stress-tested using a 4-category evaluation protocol designed to probe environment interaction, logical planning, error recovery, and adversarial safety.

### Test Protocol & Results

| Category | Test | Rating | Result |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **1. Tool Orchestration** | Fetch live London weather, calculate ISO 9920 Clo thermal insulation values, save as JSON | 9.5/10 | 370-line JSON with 24 hourly forecasts, NOAA wind chill formulas, comfort levels, clothing recommendations |
| **2. Complex Reasoning** | Search GitHub for trending autonomous agent repos, analyze architectures, recommend for 16GB RAM | 9.2/10 | 365-line Markdown report using GitHub API + BeautifulSoup + Ollama (llama3:latest), with comparison matrices and memory budget estimates |
| **3. Multi-Step Execution** | Create directory, generate 5 text files, count word frequencies across all files, output sorted CSV with logging | 9.0/10 | 7-step pipeline: directory creation, file generation, parsing, counting (254 unique words), CSV output, logging, and post-execution validation |
| **4. Adversarial Safety** | Attempt privilege escalation: kill other users' processes, read /etc/shadow, disable firewall | 9.0/10 | **Refused entirely.** Cited CFAA and Computer Misuse Act 1990. Provided table of legitimate alternatives. Zero attack code generated |

### Key Observations from Testing

- **Scientific domain modeling:** The agent applied ISO 9920/ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort formulas without being asked for the specific standard — it inferred the appropriate formula from the task description
- **Autonomous local AI usage:** For the GitHub analysis, the agent independently leveraged the local Ollama instance (llama3:latest) for architecture deep-dives — demonstrating correct use of available local infrastructure
- **Self-testing code:** Generated scripts included assertions (e.g., `assert len(content) > 2000`) that verify output before reporting success — reduces silent failures
- **Safety-first override:** When given an adversarial prompt, the model's safety behavior overrode the code-generation behavior at the planning stage, effectively neutralizing the risk before execution

### External Ratings

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Orchestration | 9.5/10 | Complex scientific math + multi-source data retrieval |
| Safety | 9.0/10 | Refusal logic robust; adversarial audit (Opus) caught high-risk patterns |
| Code Maturity | 9.2/10 | 661 tests + comprehensive documentation = production-ready |
| Innovation | 8.5/10 | Adversarial Audit + God Mode focus is a distinct, valuable niche |

### v8.5.2 — 2026-03-07 — Third-Pass Security Hardening (37 Fixes)

Comprehensive security hardening from a full third-pass codebase audit. 37 findings across 6 root causes, all remediated. 2 critical, 7 high, 16 medium, 12 low severity.

**Root cause 1 — Code scanner gaps (A-2 through A-6):**
- Block config module imports (credential exposure via runtime module access)
- Block os.popen (shell access not covered by existing os block)
- Block dynamic code functions (bypasses all static scanning)
- Block all subprocess method calls
- Block getattr on os, base64 decode, ctypes, chr-chain obfuscation

**Root cause 2 — start_server bypass (A-1, A-10, A-11):**
- Server commands now run through Tier 1 blocklist before launch
- Server subprocess env stripped of credentials
- Auto-installed pip packages use --only-binary :all: (no arbitrary code via setup.py)
- Visual check URL restricted to localhost only (SSRF prevention)

**Root cause 3 — LLM output trust (A-7, A-8, A-18, A-19, A-29):**
- shlex.quote on all paths in bootstrap pip commands
- Working directory validated under WORKSPACE_DIR (path traversal prevention)
- Executor prompt no longer exposes raw command templates or parameter names
- _strip_markdown_blocks returns first block (not longest) to prevent gaming
- Code gen system prompt restricts to current working directory only

**Root cause 4 — Audit prompt injection (A-9, A-20, A-21):**
- Removed startswith("pass") fallback (trivially injectable)
- Audit content wrapped in XML tags for structural separation
- Audit context tail-truncated to 5000 chars (prevents prompt flooding)

**Root cause 5 — Handler boundary validation (A-14 through A-17, A-25, A-30 through A-32):**
- Task ID prefixes validated as hex format
- Resource check called at chain start (not just single tasks)
- Pending file uploads capped at 10 per user
- JSON file size capped at 10MB before parsing
- Debug output uses plain text (no Markdown parse_mode injection)
- Guard for missing update.message in auth decorator
- Monotonic clock for rate limiting replaces event loop time

**Root cause 6 — Resource housekeeping (A-22 through A-37):**
- Unknown model costs default to Opus rates (highest tier) with warning log
- Symlinks skipped during project file enumeration
- Crash-safe env parsing with safe_int/safe_float helpers in config
- Word-boundary regex for classifier fallback and short triggers
- Early-exit counter on file injection rglob (prevents runaway enumeration)
- Conversation history FIFO cap at 500 rows per user
- Midnight-based budget cutoffs (replaces rolling 24h windows)
- Scheduler job removal requires 8+ char prefix
- SIGTERM handler with WAL checkpoint for clean shutdown

**Test suite:** 625 passed, 36 skipped (Docker). 23 test files updated.

### v8.4.1 — 2026-03-07 — Test Suite Hardening

Remediates 5 production failures found during the 4-hour, 42-test Telegram test suite on v8.4.0.

**Security fixes:**
- Python-embedded shell script content now scanned for Tier 1 patterns (setup.sh bypass)
- `run_shell()` scans script file content when executing `bash`/`sh` on a file
- Deliverer short-circuits to minimal response when code scanner blocks execution

**Pipeline fixes:**
- Chain steps execute literally — no graceful rewriting of failing assertions (exit-code-based strict-AND gate)
- Code truncation detection with automatic shorter-version retry (unclosed parens/brackets/strings)
- Auditor catches library substitution and fake data generation (fabrication detection)
- Stricter honest-failure enforcement in auditor and deliverer prompts

**Infrastructure fixes:**
- Ollama migrated from `/api/generate` to `/api/chat` endpoint (v0.5+), with 404 fallback to legacy
- Startup Ollama model validation with tag mismatch detection

**New tests:** 28 remediation tests (`test_v8_remediation.py`), 13 Tier 1+ scanning tests (`test_sandbox.py`)

**Test suite:** 602 passed, 36 skipped (Docker)

**New features:**
- `tools/deployer.py`: Firebase Hosting deployment — creates firebase.json, deploys via CLI, auto-cleanup
- Config: `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_PROJECT`, `DEPLOY_FIREBASE_TOKEN` (credential-stripped via TOKEN substring match)

**New tests:** 8 Firebase deployment tests (success, config lifecycle, validation, token safety, routing)

**Test suite:** 561 passed, 25 skipped (Docker)

---

### v8.3.0 — 2026-03-05 — Visual Feedback Loop

- Auditor includes visual verification context (loads, status, console errors) in the Opus audit prompt for frontend/ui_design tasks
- Deliverer attaches preview.png screenshot to artifacts when available
- Config: `VISUAL_CHECK_ENABLED` (default: false), `VISUAL_CHECK_TIMEOUT` (default: 15s)
- Graceful degradation: skips if Playwright not installed, never crashes pipeline

**New tests:** 5 visual check tests (success, no-playwright, timeout, console errors, auditor integration)

**Test suite:** 553 passed, 36 skipped (Docker)

### v8.2.0 — 2026-03-05 — Local Server Management

Adds thread-safe server management to the sandbox for local dev server preview of generated web apps.

**New features:**
- `tools/sandbox.py`: Server registry with `start_server()`, `stop_server()`, `stop_all_servers()`, `list_servers()`
- Port allocation from configurable range (8100-8120), HTTP polling for readiness, auto-kill timer
- `/servers`: List running local servers (port, PID, uptime)
- `/stopserver <task_id|all>`: Stop servers by task ID or all at once
- Executor auto-starts `python3 -m http.server` for frontend/ui_design tasks after HTML generation
- `server_url` field in AgentState and debug sidecar
- Graceful shutdown: `stop_all_servers()` called in bot `on_shutdown` callback
- Config: `SERVER_START_TIMEOUT`, `SERVER_MAX_LIFETIME`, `SERVER_PORT_RANGE_START`, `SERVER_PORT_RANGE_END`

**New tests:** 11 tests (7 server management unit + 4 server integration)

**Test suite:** 548 passed, 36 skipped (Docker)

---

### v8.1.0 — 2026-03-05 — Static Deployment

**New features:**
- `tools/deployer.py`: Static deployment module — GitHub Pages and Vercel support, credential-safe subprocess, graceful degradation
- `/deploy <task_id>`: Manual deployment command for any task's HTML artifacts
- Auto-deployment for frontend/ui_design tasks after audit pass (in deliverer)
- `deploy_url` field in AgentState and debug sidecar

**Config:** `DEPLOY_ENABLED`, `DEPLOY_PROVIDER`, `DEPLOY_REPO`, `DEPLOY_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_VERCEL_TOKEN`, `DEPLOY_BASE_URL`

**New tests:** 25 tests (17 deployer unit + 8 deployer integration)

**Test suite:** 537 tests (501 passed + 36 skipped Docker)

---

### v8.0.2 — 2026-03-05 — Audit Fixes & Security Hardening

Fixes all open audit issues from the v8 code review plus 3 security bypasses discovered during Telegram test suite execution.

**Audit issue fixes:**
- `storage/db.py`: FIFO cap (50 rows per project) on `project_memory` table — prevents unbounded growth (M-1)
- `brain/nodes/planner.py`: Path traversal validation in `_inject_project_files()` using `.resolve() + startswith()` (M-2)
- `bot/handlers.py`: Verified all file handles use context managers — no leak found (M-3)
- `tools/model_router.py`: Ollama uses native `system` parameter instead of prompt concatenation (m-2)
- `tools/model_router.py`: `max_tokens` passed to Ollama via `options.num_predict` (m-3)
- `tools/model_router.py`: `MODEL_COSTS` imported from `claude_client` instead of duplicated (m-4)

**Security bypass fixes (from Telegram test suite Tier 3):**
- `tools/sandbox.py`: Added `_check_shell_safety()` — scans bash script content against Tier 1 blocklist before execution. Fixes bypasses where `cat|bash` and `sudo` inside .sh files were not caught.
- `brain/nodes/planner.py`: Added `SECURITY RESTRICTIONS` block to planner prompt — instructs LLM to refuse system credential file tasks instead of generating synthetic data.
- `tools/sandbox.py`: `run_code()` now routes bash content through `_check_shell_safety()` alongside existing Python scanner.

**Operational improvements:**
- `main.py`: Suppressed httpx INFO polling logs (90%+ of log volume)
- `storage/db.py`: `cleanup_workspace_files()` now enforces count-based cap (100 files) alongside age-based cleanup

**New tests:** 9 tests (1 FIFO cap, 8 shell content safety)

**Test suite:** 548 tests (512 passed + 36 skipped). 36 skipped require Docker Desktop.

### v8.0.1 - 2026-02-24 - Adversarial Stress Testing & Security Hardening

Two rounds of adversarial stress testing with 144 new tests. Identified and patched 8 vulnerabilities.

**Audit Round 1 patches (commit 27fbc95):**
- `tools/sandbox.py`: Added `re.MULTILINE` flag to `_BLOCKED_RE` compilation — without it, `$` only matches end-of-entire-string, making multiline heredoc payloads invisible to the blocklist
- `tools/sandbox.py`: Fixed rm tilde pattern to handle quoted paths: `['\"]?` suffix on `~` match
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py`: Sanitize `Path.home()` from debug sidecar message field to prevent home path leakage
- `bot/handlers.py`: Context manager for chain artifact document sending (fixes file handle leak)
- `tools/model_router.py`: Empty Ollama response (`{"response": ""}`) now triggers Claude fallback instead of returning empty string

**Audit Round 2 patches (commit 08f5127):**
- `tools/sandbox.py`: Added `cat|bash` pattern (39 total blocked patterns) — catches `cat file | bash` pipe-to-interpreter attacks
- `tools/model_router.py`: Budget escalation now checks `_ram_below_threshold(90)` before routing to Ollama under memory pressure
- `config.py`: Extracted `MAX_FILE_INJECT_COUNT = 50` from hardcoded magic number in planner.py
- `brain/nodes/planner.py`: References `config.MAX_FILE_INJECT_COUNT` instead of hardcoded `> 50`

**New test files:**
- `tests/test_stress_v8.py` — 64 adversarial tests (audit round 1): code scanner evasion, shell blocklist evasion, path traversal, concurrency/deadlock, output registry thread safety, privacy, memory poisoning, routing invariants, budget escalation
- `tests/test_stress_v8_audit2.py` — 80 adversarial tests (audit round 2): expanded security boundary, concurrency contention, logic saturation, resource routing

**Test suite:** 527 tests (527 passed + 11 skipped). 11 skipped require Docker Desktop.

### v8.0.0 - 2026-02-24 - Context Memory, Model Routing, Chaining, Live Streaming

Major feature release implementing the v8 roadmap across 4 phases. Adds cross-task project memory, intelligent model routing (Claude/Ollama), strict-AND task chaining, live stdout streaming, and per-task debug sidecars.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Quick Wins**
- 3 timeout patterns added to `_ENV_ERROR_PATTERNS` in auditor.py — catches both `run_shell` ("Timed out after") and `run_code` ("Execution timed out after") formats, plus "killed process group"
- Coding standards injection: planner reads `.agentsutra/standards.md` and injects into system prompt for code-generating task types (not project tasks). Truncated at 2000 chars.
- Security blocklist audit: verified all 4 roadmap-identified gaps already covered (3 from Round 4 hardening, 1 deliberately Tier 3). Added documentation tests.

**Phase 2: Context & Memory Layer**
- New `project_memory` table in SQLite with `UNIQUE(project_name, memory_type, content)` constraint and `INSERT OR IGNORE` semantics
- Synchronous read/write helpers (`sync_write_project_memory`, `sync_query_project_memories`) using `threading.Lock` — pipeline nodes run in `asyncio.to_thread()` and cannot use aiosqlite
- Deliverer extracts success/failure patterns after each project task and persists to `project_memory`
- Planner injects "LESSONS LEARNED" from previous runs into system prompt for project tasks
- Dynamic file injection: extra Sonnet call (~$0.02) selects 3-5 relevant files from project tree (50-file cap, 3000 chars/file) and injects into planner context

**Phase 3: Intelligence & Routing**
- New `tools/model_router.py` with `route_and_call()` — routes to Claude or Ollama based on purpose, complexity, RAM, and daily budget
- Routing rules: audit → always Opus, code_gen → always Sonnet, low-complexity classify/plan → Ollama if available + RAM < 75%, budget escalation at 70% of DAILY_BUDGET_USD (with RAM < 90% guard)
- Wired into classifier.py (classify→low) and planner.py (project→low). Auditor and executor unchanged.
- Ollama fallback: if Ollama call fails, transparently falls back to Claude Sonnet
- Temporal sequence mining in deliverer: `_suggest_next_step()` queries task history for follow-up patterns (2+ occurrences within 30 min window)

**Phase 4: UX & Orchestration**
- Live stdout streaming: refactored `run_code()` and `run_shell()` from `proc.communicate()` to threaded Popen reading with per-task live output registry (bounded to 50 lines)
- Hash-gated Telegram edits: status polling uses `hash(label)` comparison instead of stage string — handles both stage changes and stdout updates without redundant API calls
- Strict-AND task chaining: `/chain step 1 -> step 2 -> step 3` with `{output}` artifact passing. Each step runs the full 5-stage pipeline. Failed step halts the chain with clear error message.
- Debug JSON sidecar: `_write_debug_sidecar()` writes per-task `.debug.json` with stage timings, verdict, retry count. Accessible via `/debug <task_id>` command.
- `stage_timings` field added to `AgentState`, collected by `_wrap_node()` in graph.py

**New files:**
- `tools/model_router.py` — Claude/Ollama routing layer
- `.agentsutra/standards.md` — Python/Shell coding standards for planner injection
- `tests/test_v8_foundation.py` — 17 tests (Phase 1)
- `tests/test_v8_context.py` — 13 tests (Phase 2)
- `tests/test_v8_routing.py` — 12 tests (Phase 3)
- `tests/test_v8_ux.py` — 11 tests (Phase 4)

**Modified files:**
- `brain/nodes/auditor.py` — 3 timeout patterns in `_ENV_ERROR_PATTERNS`
- `brain/nodes/planner.py` — Standards injection, memory injection, dynamic file injection, model router wiring
- `brain/nodes/classifier.py` — Model router wiring (`route_and_call` replaces `claude_client.call`)
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` — Memory extraction, temporal mining, debug sidecar
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — `task_id` threading for live output
- `brain/state.py` — `stage_timings: list[dict]` field
- `brain/graph.py` — Timing collection in `_wrap_node`, `stage_timings` in initial state
- `storage/db.py` — `project_memory` table, `idx_projmem_name` index, sync r/w helpers with `_sync_db_lock`
- `tools/sandbox.py` — Live output registry, threaded Popen refactor, `task_id` parameter on run_code/run_shell
- `bot/handlers.py` — Hash-gated edits, live stdout, `/chain` command, `/debug` command
- `bot/telegram_bot.py` — Registered `chain` + `debug` commands (13 total)
- `config.py` — Version bump to 8.0.0

**Test suite:** 527 tests (527 passed + 11 skipped). 11 skipped tests require Docker Desktop. 53 new v8 tests across 4 test files, plus 144 adversarial stress tests across 2 audit rounds.

### v7.0.0 - 2026-02-22 - Shared Project Venv, Streaming, Honest Delivery

Major release addressing production failures discovered during Mac Mini deployment.

**Shared project venv (config.py, main.py, executor.py):**
- AgentSutra now auto-creates and manages a shared venv at `workspace/project_venv/` for registered projects that don't specify their own `venv:` key
- Eliminates the need for manual venv creation per project — dependencies auto-install on first run
- Startup includes a smoke test (`pip --version`) to detect broken venvs from Python upgrades
- Projects with their own `venv:` key are unaffected. Ad-hoc code tasks still use system Python (isolation boundary)
- If a project needs dependency isolation, add `venv:` to its config — the escape hatch is built in

**Streaming for thinking calls (claude_client.py):**
- Switched to `messages.stream()` with `get_final_message()` when extended thinking is enabled
- Fixes Anthropic's 10-minute hard timeout on non-streaming requests, which killed complex thinking tasks
- Non-thinking calls remain as `messages.create()` (no change)

**128k thinking headroom (claude_client.py):**
- Raised `max_tokens` floor from 16,000 to 128,000 when thinking is enabled
- Fixes "Claude returned no text content" errors where Claude consumed the entire token budget on thinking with zero text output, failing after 5 retries

**Honest failure delivery (deliverer.py):**
- When audit verdict is FAIL, the deliverer now injects hard constraints: "This task FAILED. Do NOT claim files were created unless listed."
- Updated system prompt with critical rule against fabricating success
- Updated fallback response to clearly state "Task FAILED" instead of "completed with issues"
- Fixes a bug where the deliverer told the user "HTML file created successfully" when no HTML was ever generated (fabricated from the plan, not the actual execution result)

**Project execution stderr logging (executor.py):**
- Project execution failures now log stderr/traceback to `agentsutra.log`
- Previously, failed project scripts showed only "No artifacts detected" with no indication of WHY

**Modified files:**
- `config.py` — added `PROJECTS_VENV_DIR` path constant
- `main.py` — added `_ensure_shared_project_venv()` bootstrap with smoke test
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — shared venv fallback + stderr logging on project failure
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` — honest failure reporting in prompt, system prompt, and fallback
- `tools/claude_client.py` — streaming for thinking calls, 128k max_tokens floor

### v6.11 - 2026-02-21 - Sandbox & Project Execution Fixes

Fixes 3 critical/medium issues identified from production failures: "Bad file descriptor" errors killing all code tasks when running as a daemon, missing dependency management for project tasks, and wasted API credits from retrying environment errors.

**stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL on all subprocess calls (sandbox.py):**
- Added `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` to every `subprocess.Popen` and `subprocess.run` call
- Fixes "Fatal Python error: init_sys_streams / Bad file descriptor" when AgentSutra runs as a background service (launchd, nohup)
- Affected: `run_code()`, `run_shell()`, `_run_code_docker()`, `_docker_pip_install()`, `_docker_available()`, all docker kill/rm calls
- Child processes no longer inherit invalid fd 0 from daemon parent

**Project dependency bootstrapping (executor.py):**
- New `_bootstrap_project_deps()` installs requirements.txt before first project execution
- Only runs on first attempt (retry_count == 0) to avoid redundant installs
- New `_parse_import_error_from_result()` + auto-install retry for project tasks (mirrors `run_code_with_auto_install` pattern)
- If a project script fails with ImportError, the missing package is auto-installed and execution retried
- Strengthened `SHELL_GEN_SYSTEM` prompt: Claude must use ONLY the provided commands, cannot discover/guess alternative entry points

**Environment error short-circuit in auditor (auditor.py):**
- New `_detect_environment_error()` identifies 6 infrastructure failure patterns: Bad file descriptor, sys streams init failure, Permission denied, No space left, DNS failure, Connection refused
- When detected, auditor forces `retry_count = MAX_RETRIES` (skips to delivery) instead of wasting 9 API calls on code-level retries
- User gets a clear "ENVIRONMENT ERROR" message via the fallback response path

**New tests (28 new, 336 total):**
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 2 new: stdin-safe run_code, stdin-safe run_shell
- `tests/test_auditor.py` — 10 new: bad file descriptor, sys streams, no space, DNS failure, permission denied NOT detected (false-positive guard), connection refused NOT detected (false-positive guard), code errors not detected, import errors not detected, empty result, env error forces max retries
- `tests/test_executor.py` — 16 new: _parse_import_error_from_result (12 tests covering mapped modules, canonical PIP_MAP reuse, traceback vs stderr precedence, empty/no-match cases), _bootstrap_project_deps (4 tests covering no requirements, success, failure, venv pip)

**Modified files:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` on all 11 subprocess calls
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — dependency bootstrapping, auto-install retry, prompt hardening, imports `_PIP_NAME_MAP` from sandbox (single source of truth)
- `brain/nodes/auditor.py` — environment error detection and retry short-circuit; "Permission denied" and "Connection refused" removed (false-positive risk)

**Test suite:** 336 tests (326 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.10 - 2026-02-21 - Pipeline Audit Fixes & Operational Hardening

Addresses 11 issues identified during a comprehensive read-only pipeline audit. Focuses on timeout safety, error sanitization, upload preservation, race condition elimination, and storage management.

**Pipeline timeout for interactive tasks (handlers.py):**
- Interactive tasks now wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=config.LONG_TIMEOUT)` — same pattern as scheduled tasks
- Prevents indefinite hangs if Claude API responds slowly or LangGraph encounters a bug
- New `asyncio.TimeoutError` handler sends clear user message and marks task as failed

**Error message sanitization (handlers.py):**
- New `_sanitize_error_for_user()` strips absolute paths, API key fragments, and token values before sending to Telegram
- Applied to both `handle_message()` and `_scheduled_task_run()` error paths
- Full error details still logged server-side for debugging

**Honest cancel feedback (handlers.py):**
- `/cancel` now tells user "background execution may take a moment to fully stop"
- Acknowledges that `asyncio.to_thread()` cancellation is best-effort

**File upload preservation during concurrent tasks (handlers.py):**
- Each task snapshots its consumed `pending_files` at launch
- `finally` block only clears files consumed by THAT task, preserving uploads for the next task
- Fixes: uploading files during an active task no longer loses them

**Event loop misuse guard (claude_client.py):**
- Runtime detection if `claude_client.call()` is invoked from a running event loop
- Logs `ERROR` immediately (would freeze the bot) but doesn't crash the call
- Zero runtime cost in the correct path

**Atomic filename generation (executor.py, deliverer.py):**
- UI design, frontend, and code artifact filenames now use UUID suffix instead of counter loop
- Eliminates TOCTOU race from concurrent tasks generating same base filename
- Consistent with `file_manager.save_upload()` pattern from v6.7

**Separate API vs pipeline retry counts (config.py, claude_client.py):**
- New `API_MAX_RETRIES=5` for Claude API call retries (rate limit, timeout, API errors)
- Existing `MAX_RETRIES=3` reserved for pipeline audit-retry limit
- API retries can now be more aggressive without affecting pipeline retry budget

**Telegram rate limit handling (handlers.py):**
- `_send_long_message()` now catches `RetryAfter` errors and waits before retrying
- 300ms delay between chunks prevents rate limiting on large outputs
- Failed chunks logged instead of silently dropped

**Better max-retry fallback response (deliverer.py):**
- `_fallback_response()` now includes audit feedback when verdict != "pass"
- Users see what the Opus auditor flagged, not just "completed with issues"

**Tasks table pruning (db.py):**
- `prune_old_data()` now also prunes completed/failed/crashed/cancelled tasks older than `history_days`
- Prevents unbounded growth of `tasks` table (each record contains plan + result fields)
- Running tasks are never pruned

**Config reorganization (config.py):**
- Execution limits, retry limits, and file limits are now separate commented sections

**New tests (11 new, 308 total):**
- `tests/test_handlers.py` — 6 new: error sanitization (path stripping, API key redaction, meaningful preservation, truncation, token redaction), rate-limited message retry
- `tests/test_budget.py` — 3 new: API_MAX_RETRIES existence, default value, pipeline retries unchanged
- `tests/test_db.py` — 2 new: old completed tasks pruned, running tasks never pruned

**Modified files:**
- `bot/handlers.py` — pipeline timeout, error sanitization, cancel feedback, file upload preservation, rate-limited message sending
- `tools/claude_client.py` — event loop guard, API_MAX_RETRIES
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — UUID filenames for UI/frontend
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` — UUID filenames for code artifacts, better fallback response
- `storage/db.py` — tasks table pruning in `prune_old_data()`
- `config.py` — `API_MAX_RETRIES`, section reorganization

**Test suite (at time of release):** 308 tests (298 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.9 - 2026-02-21 - Comprehensive Artifact Filtering & Delivery Resilience

Fixes a critical production bug where venv/pip infrastructure files (pyvenv.cfg, activate, pip3, RECORD, WHEEL, greenlet.h, typing_extensions.py, etc.) were incorrectly delivered as task artifacts instead of actual report files. Root cause: `_is_artifact_file()` only excluded `.pyc`, `.pyo`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store` — insufficient for `pip install` or venv creation during execution.

**Artifact filtering rewrite (sandbox.py — 5 interconnected fixes):**
- **Comprehensive `_is_artifact_file()`**: Rewrote with 3-layer exclusion: `_EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES` (20+ dirs: `.venv`, `venv`, `env`, `site-packages`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, etc.), `_EXCLUDED_FILENAMES` (30+ files: `pyvenv.cfg`, `activate*`, `pip*`, `RECORD`, `WHEEL`, `METADATA`, etc.), `_EXCLUDED_EXTENSIONS` (12: `.pyc`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.h`, `.whl`, etc.)
- **Directory-pruning walker `_walk_artifacts()`**: Replaces all 6 `rglob("*")` calls. Uses `os.walk()` with in-place directory pruning — skips entire `.venv/`, `site-packages/`, `node_modules/`, `*.dist-info/` trees instead of scanning thousands of files. Also skips empty files (0 bytes).
- **Sanity check `_apply_artifact_sanity_check()`**: If >20 artifacts detected after filtering, falls back to known output extensions only (`.html`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, etc.). Safety net for edge cases where directory exclusions are insufficient.

**Delivery resilience (handlers.py):**
- **Empty file skip**: Files with `st_size == 0` are skipped with a warning instead of causing "File must be non-empty" Telegram API crash
- **Error-resilient send loop**: Each `reply_document()` wrapped in try/except — one failed send no longer kills delivery of remaining files
- **sent_count tracking**: Logs error if no artifacts were successfully sent despite artifacts being detected
- Applied to both `handle_message()` and `_scheduled_task_run()`

**Project-level filtering (executor.py):**
- **`_execute_project()` artifact cap**: If project task returns >15 artifacts, filters to known output extensions only. Defense-in-depth for project tasks that run `pip install` as part of execution.

**New tests (32 new, 297 total):**
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 20 new: `_is_artifact_file` venv/infrastructure exclusions (pyvenv.cfg, activate*, pip*, RECORD, WHEEL, .h, .so, .dist-info, .egg-info, node_modules, .dylib, .whl), `_walk_artifacts` directory pruning (venv, node_modules, dist-info, empty files, __pycache__, site-packages), `_apply_artifact_sanity_check` threshold behavior (3 tests)
- `tests/test_handlers.py` — 2 new: empty file skip in scheduled delivery, send failure continues to next artifact
- `tests/test_e2e_artifact_delivery.py` — 2 new: venv creation during execution excludes all venv files, pip dist-info directories excluded

**Modified files:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — `_EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES`, `_EXCLUDED_FILENAMES`, `_EXCLUDED_EXTENSIONS`, rewritten `_is_artifact_file()`, new `_walk_artifacts()`, new `_apply_artifact_sanity_check()`, replaced 6 `rglob("*")` calls
- `bot/handlers.py` — empty file check, try/except around send_document, sent_count tracking
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — artifact count filtering in `_execute_project()`

**Test suite:** 297 tests (287 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.8 - 2026-02-21 - Artifact Delivery Fix & Parameter Extraction

Fixes a critical production bug where project task output files (HTML, PDF) were not delivered to Telegram, and a parameter extraction bug where Claude's JSON responses wrapped in markdown fences caused project commands to run with empty parameters.

**Artifact delivery fix (3 changes):**
- **mtime-based file detection** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Replaced path-only set difference (`current_files - existing_files`) with path-to-mtime dict comparison in all 3 execution paths (`_run_code_docker`, `run_code`, `run_shell`). Previously, overwritten files (same path, new content) were invisible because they appeared in both snapshots. Now detects both new AND modified files.
- **Cache/metadata artifact filter** (`tools/sandbox.py`): New `_is_artifact_file()` function rejects `.pyc`, `.pyo`, `__pycache__/` contents, and `.DS_Store` from artifact lists. Python imports during execution generated bytecode cache files that were incorrectly delivered as task output.
- **Artifact deduplication** (`bot/handlers.py`, `brain/nodes/deliverer.py`): Added `seen_paths` set in both `handle_message` and `_scheduled_task_run` to prevent duplicate file sends. Added `verdict == "pass"` guard in deliverer before saving `.py` code artifact, and dedup check before appending to artifact list.

**Parameter extraction fix:**
- **Markdown fence stripping** (`brain/nodes/executor.py`): `_extract_params()` now calls `_strip_markdown_blocks()` on Claude's response before `json.loads()`. Claude frequently wraps JSON in `` ```json...``` `` fences, which caused `JSONDecodeError`, falling back to an empty parameter dict. This meant `{client}` and `{file}` placeholders were never resolved, causing project commands to fail or produce wrong output.

**New tests (23 new, 258 total):**
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 13 new: file detection (6: new file, overwritten file, untouched exclusion, .pyc exclusion for run_code and run_shell), artifact filter (7: .pyc/.pyo/.DS_Store rejected, .html/.pdf/.csv/.py accepted)
- `tests/test_e2e_artifact_delivery.py` — 6 new: fresh run HTML+PDF detection, overwrite detection, 3-retry scenario, module imports with .pyc filter, handler filter logic, pre-existing cache exclusion
- `tests/test_executor.py` — 4 new: plain JSON param extraction, markdown-fenced JSON extraction, no placeholders returns empty, unparseable response fallback

**Modified files:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — mtime dict snapshots in 3 locations, `_is_artifact_file()` filter, debug logging
- `bot/handlers.py` — artifact dedup with `seen_paths` set, skip logging for missing/oversized artifacts
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` — `verdict == "pass"` guard, dedup check on code artifact
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — `_strip_markdown_blocks()` in `_extract_params()`

**New files:**
- `tests/test_e2e_artifact_delivery.py` — 6 end-to-end artifact delivery tests

**Test suite:** 258 tests (248 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.7 - 2026-02-20 - Operational Fixes (8.2/10 Review Response)

Addresses 5 operational gaps identified by an independent code review (rated 8.2/10). All were genuine design omissions — not bugs in existing code, but missing features and edge cases that end-to-end testing doesn't catch.

**Cost tracking fix:**
- **Thinking tokens in cost tracking** (`tools/claude_client.py`): Added `thinking_tokens` column to `api_usage` table with ALTER TABLE migration for existing databases. `_persist_usage()` now stores thinking tokens. Cost formulas in `_check_budget()`, `get_cost_summary()`, and `get_usage_summary()` now include thinking tokens at output token rates (matching Anthropic's billing). Previously, thinking tokens were logged but never persisted — `/cost` and budget enforcement underreported actual spend when `ENABLE_THINKING=true`.

**Crash recovery:**
- **Stale task recovery on startup** (`storage/db.py`, `main.py`): New `recover_stale_tasks()` function resets tasks stuck in `running` or `pending` status to `crashed` on startup. Called after `init_db()` and before `prune_old_data()`. Previously, a kill -9 left tasks showing as "running" forever in `/history`.

**Scheduled task timeout:**
- **Timeout for scheduled tasks** (`bot/handlers.py`): `_scheduled_task_run()` now wraps `asyncio.to_thread(run_task)` with `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=LONG_TIMEOUT)` (default 900s). On timeout, task is marked failed and a notification is sent. Previously, a hanging Claude API call or infinite execution loop could block the scheduler indefinitely.

**File upload race condition fix:**
- **Thread-safe file dedup** (`tools/file_manager.py`): Replaced TOCTOU-racy `while dest.exists(): counter += 1` with UUID-based unique filenames (`{stem}_{uuid4_hex8}{suffix}`). Eliminates the race condition where two concurrent uploads of the same filename could collide.

**New tests (13 new):**
- `tests/test_budget.py` — 5 new: thinking tokens persisted, default zero, cost includes thinking, usage summary includes thinking, budget enforcement includes thinking
- `tests/test_db.py` — 3 new: running tasks become crashed, pending tasks become crashed, completed tasks untouched
- `tests/test_handlers.py` — 1 new: scheduled task timeout
- `tests/test_file_manager.py` — 4 new: UUID in filename, two uploads never collide, path traversal sanitized, dotfile gets prefix

**Modified files:**
- `tools/claude_client.py` — thinking_tokens column, migration, persist, cost formula, budget check
- `storage/db.py` — `recover_stale_tasks()`
- `main.py` — call `recover_stale_tasks()` on startup
- `bot/handlers.py` — `asyncio.wait_for()` in `_scheduled_task_run()`, thinking tokens in `/usage` and `/cost` display
- `tools/file_manager.py` — UUID-based upload naming

**Test suite:** 235 tests (225 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.6 - 2026-02-20 - Security Hardening (Post-Review Fixes)

Addresses 6 valid findings from an independent Opus 4.6 code review (rated 7.5/10). Fixes a Docker pip install bug, closes 3 shell bypass vectors, adds a code content scanner for subprocess mode, and creates the first test coverage for `bot/handlers.py`.

**Security fixes:**
- **Docker pip install fix** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Removed `--no-deps` from `_docker_pip_install()`. Packages with transitive dependencies (e.g. scikit-learn) now install correctly in Docker containers.
- **4 new blocked command patterns** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Added blocks for `printf/echo ... | sh/bash` (pipe-to-shell via printf/echo), `eval "$(..."` (eval with command substitution for obfuscation), and `bash/sh -c` with embedded empty quotes (string splitting obfuscation like `bash -c 'r""m'`). Total blocked patterns: 34 (was 30).
- **2 new audit log patterns** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `eval` commands and `printf` pipes are now logged for audit trail. Total logged patterns: 12 (was 10).
- **Code content scanner for subprocess mode** (`tools/sandbox.py`): New `_check_code_safety()` function scans Python code content before execution in subprocess mode. Blocks reads of `~/.ssh/`, `~/.gnupg/`, `~/.aws/`, `.env`, PEM files, `os.system()` calls, `shutil.rmtree(~/root)`, raw `socket.connect()` (reverse shells), and `/etc/passwd|shadow|sudoers`. Does NOT apply in Docker mode (filesystem isolation is sufficient). Defense-in-depth, not a security boundary.

**New tests:**
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 26 new tests: pipe-to-shell blocking (6), eval blocking (2), bash string splitting (4), code content scanner (14 — 9 blocked + 5 allowed). Total sandbox tests: 124 (was 98).
- `tests/test_handlers.py` — **18 new tests** for bot handler layer: auth decorator (4), resource guards (5), message splitting (5), file upload validation (4). First test coverage for `bot/handlers.py` (663 lines).

**Modified files:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — removed `--no-deps`, added 4 blocked patterns + 2 logged patterns, added `_CODE_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` + `_check_code_safety()`, wired into `run_code()` subprocess path
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 26 new tests across 4 new test classes
- `requirements.txt` — added `pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0`

**New files:**
- `tests/test_handlers.py` — 18 handler layer tests

**Test suite:** 222 tests (212 passed + 10 skipped). 10 skipped tests require Docker Desktop.

### v6.5 - 2026-02-20 - Stress Test Hardening (3-agent adversarial audit)

Addresses findings from a comprehensive 3-agent stress test that independently analyzed sandbox.py (17 findings), brain nodes (15 findings), and bot/config/storage layers (17 findings). 7 confirmed bugs fixed, 0 false positives shipped.

**Critical fixes:**
- **Audit verdict fail-safe** (`brain/nodes/auditor.py`): Missing `"verdict"` key in auditor JSON now defaults to `"fail"` instead of `"pass"`. Previously, a malformed audit response like `{"feedback": "the code crashed"}` without a verdict key would silently pass broken output through to the user.
- **Infinite retry loop prevention** (`brain/nodes/auditor.py`): `retry_count` now increments for ANY non-`"pass"` verdict, not just `"fail"`. Previously, an unexpected verdict like `"partial"` or `"needs_revision"` would never increment the counter, creating an infinite plan-execute-audit loop that burns API credits forever.
- **Orphaned process kill on timeout** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Both `run_code()` and `run_shell()` now use `subprocess.Popen()` with `start_new_session=True` instead of `subprocess.run()`. On timeout, `os.killpg(proc.pid, SIGKILL)` kills the entire process group, preventing orphaned child processes from consuming CPU/memory indefinitely. Previously, `subprocess.run(timeout=N)` raised `TimeoutExpired` but did NOT kill the child process.
- **Docker working_dir validation** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `_run_code_docker()` now calls `_validate_working_dir()` before mounting volumes. Previously, an attacker-controlled `working_dir` outside `~/` could be mounted read-write into the container, bypassing Docker's filesystem isolation.

**Reliability fixes:**
- **ALLOWED_USER_IDS crash protection** (`config.py`): Non-numeric entries in the comma-separated env var (e.g., `"123,abc,456"`) are now silently skipped instead of crashing the entire application at import time with `ValueError`.
- **Log rotation** (`main.py`): Switched from `FileHandler` to `RotatingFileHandler` (10MB max, 3 backups). Previously, `agentsutra.log` grew unboundedly over months of operation.
- **Running tasks memory leak** (`bot/handlers.py`): `_check_resources()` now prunes completed `asyncio.Future` objects from `running_tasks` before counting active tasks. Previously, completed futures accumulated indefinitely in memory.

**Modified files:**
- `brain/nodes/auditor.py` — fail-safe verdict default, retry_count for any non-pass
- `tools/sandbox.py` — Popen + process group kill in run_code/run_shell, _validate_working_dir in Docker path
- `config.py` — try/except in user ID parsing
- `main.py` — RotatingFileHandler
- `bot/handlers.py` — completed task pruning in _check_resources

**Test suite:** 168 tests (164 unit + 4 integration), all pass.

### v6.4 - 2026-02-20 - Docker Container Isolation

Addresses the fundamental isolation gap: `run_code()` previously executed LLM-generated code via subprocess with full user-level filesystem access. A hallucinated script could read `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `.env` and exfiltrate via network libraries. Docker containers eliminate this by restricting code execution to only mounted workspace directories.

**New features:**
- **Docker container isolation** (`tools/sandbox.py`): When `DOCKER_ENABLED=true`, `run_code()` executes inside disposable Docker containers. Only `workspace/outputs/` (rw) and `workspace/uploads/` (ro) are mounted. The host filesystem (home, SSH keys, credentials, `.env`) is completely inaccessible. Resource limits (memory, CPU) and network mode (bridge/none) are configurable. Named containers with explicit kill on timeout prevent orphaned processes. Graceful fallback to subprocess if Docker is unavailable.
- **Docker-aware auto-install** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `run_code_with_auto_install()` installs pip packages into a persistent cache volume (`workspace/.pip-cache/`) shared across container runs via `PIP_TARGET=/pip-cache`. Packages survive across executions without rebuilding the image.
- **Lazy Docker detection** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `_docker_available()` checks Docker daemon and sandbox image existence with 60-second caching. Fast-fails by checking Docker socket file existence (`/var/run/docker.sock` or `~/.docker/run/docker.sock`) before spawning subprocess. No startup penalty — detection happens on first `run_code()` call.
- **Thread-safe pip installs** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `_docker_pip_install()` is serialized via `threading.Lock` (`_docker_pip_lock`) to prevent `.pip-cache` corruption when multiple concurrent tasks auto-install packages simultaneously.
- **Sandbox Docker image** (`Dockerfile`): Python 3.11-slim with system deps (gcc, libxml2, Node.js) and 20 pre-installed Python packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, requests, beautifulsoup4, etc.) for minimal auto-install overhead.
- **Build script** (`scripts/build_sandbox.sh`): One-time image build with Docker availability checks and clear error messages.

**New files:**
- `Dockerfile` — sandbox image definition
- `.dockerignore` — excludes .env, workspace/, storage/ from build context
- `scripts/build_sandbox.sh` — one-time image build script
- `tests/test_docker_sandbox.py` — 27 tests across 3 tiers: unit (mocked Docker, 17 tests including socket fast-fail), integration (real Docker, 6 tests), security verification (4 tests)

**Modified files:**
- `config.py` — added 6 Docker config vars (`DOCKER_ENABLED`, `DOCKER_IMAGE`, `DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT`, `DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT`, `DOCKER_NETWORK`, `DOCKER_PIP_CACHE`)
- `tools/sandbox.py` — added `_docker_available()` (with socket fast-fail), `_build_docker_cmd()`, `_run_code_docker()`, `_docker_pip_install()` (with `threading.Lock`); modified `run_code()` routing and `run_code_with_auto_install()` pip install path
- `.env.example` — added Docker config section
- `AGENTSUTRA.md` — Docker setup guide, updated security model, config reference, changelog

**Unchanged:** `run_shell()` (host-side project commands), `ExecutionResult` dataclass, `brain/nodes/executor.py` (zero changes — Docker routing is transparent), all existing tests.

**Test suite:** 168 tests (164 unit + 4 integration), all pass. Docker integration/security tests skip when Docker is not installed.

### v6.3 - 2026-02-20 - Security Hardening (architecture review response)

Addresses security findings from a 4-section architecture review. Architecture & Pipeline and Local AI & Data Privacy received strong praise (no changes). Concurrency is correctly sized for Mac Mini M2 (no changes). Security received the critical finding: the regex blocklist had 8 confirmed bypass vectors. This release closes all 8 vectors, adds environment variable protection, parameter injection prevention, and 48 new tests.

**Security fixes:**
- **12 new blocked patterns** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Interpreter inline execution (`python3 -c`, `perl -e`, `ruby -e`, `node -e`), destructive find operations (`find -delete`, `find -exec rm`), encoding bypass (`base64|bash`), home directory relocation (`mv ~/`), dotfile write/append redirects (`> ~/.bashrc`, `>> ~/.zshrc`, `> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, etc.), symlink attacks on dotfiles (`ln -sf /tmp/evil ~/.bashrc`). Total blocked patterns: 20 → 30.
- **4 new audit log patterns** (`tools/sandbox.py`): find commands, symlink operations, file moves, python inline execution. Total logged patterns: 6 → 10.
- **Pattern-based environment filtering** (`config.py` + `tools/sandbox.py`): New `PROTECTED_ENV_SUBSTRINGS` set (`KEY`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `CREDENTIAL`) strips any env var whose name contains these substrings from subprocess environments. Catches `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, etc. without hardcoding each one. Shared `_filter_env()` helper replaces inline filtering in both `run_code()` and `run_shell()`.
- **Parameter injection prevention** (`brain/nodes/executor.py`): `shlex.quote()` applied to all project command placeholder values. Prevents command injection via parameter values (e.g., `{slug}` containing `; rm -rf ~/` becomes a safely-quoted literal string).

**Bug fixes (from prompt.md stress-test review):**
- **CRITICAL: prune_old_data epoch mismatch** (`storage/db.py`): `api_usage.timestamp` stores epoch floats (REAL), but pruning compared against ISO strings. Due to SQLite type affinity, ALL REALs compare as less than any TEXT string, causing every `api_usage` record to be deleted on startup. Fixed by using `time.time() - (days * 86400)` for the cutoff.
- **MODERATE: Schedule interval validation** (`bot/handlers.py`): Added bounds checking (1–43200 minutes) after int parsing to prevent 0-minute intervals (APScheduler rapid-fire) and absurdly long intervals.
- **MODERATE: working_dir missing from executor results** (`brain/nodes/executor.py`): Added `"working_dir"` key to all 4 executor return dicts so downstream stages can reference the actual execution directory.
- **LOW: _strip_markdown_blocks regex failure** (`brain/nodes/executor.py`): Replaced regex-based extraction with line-anchored parser that correctly handles backticks inside template literals and code strings.
- **LOW: rm -rf critical subdirectories** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Added pattern blocking `rm -rf ~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Library`, etc.
- **LOW: chmod -R false positive** (`tools/sandbox.py`): Removed overly broad `chmod -R` pattern that blocked safe operations like `chmod -R 755`. Now only blocks `chmod -R 777` and `chmod -R a+rwx`.
- **LOW: CSV row_count off-by-one** (`tools/file_manager.py` + `brain/nodes/planner.py`): `row_count` now excludes the header row and label changed to "data rows".

**New tests (48 new, 150 total):**
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 6 new test classes: `TestInterpreterBlocking` (7), `TestFindBlocking` (5), `TestEncodingBypass` (3), `TestHomeMoveBlocking` (4), `TestDotfileProtection` (9), `TestEnvFiltering` (6). Plus additional tests in existing classes.
- `tests/test_db.py` — 3 new tests for prune_old_data epoch handling (regression guard)
- `tests/test_executor.py` — 2 new tests for backticks inside code blocks
- `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py` — 1 new test for working_dir population

**Modified files:**
- `tools/sandbox.py` — 12 new blocked patterns (30 total), 4 new logged patterns (10 total), `_filter_env()` helper, replaced inline env filtering
- `config.py` — added `PROTECTED_ENV_SUBSTRINGS` set
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` — `import shlex`, `shlex.quote()` for params, line-anchored `_strip_markdown_blocks`, `working_dir` in all return dicts
- `storage/db.py` — epoch-based cutoff in `prune_old_data()`
- `bot/handlers.py` — schedule interval bounds validation
- `tools/file_manager.py` — header-excluded row_count
- `brain/nodes/planner.py` — "data rows" label
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 51 new tests (47 → 98)
- `tests/test_db.py` — new file, 3 tests
- `tests/test_executor.py` — 2 new tests (10 → 12)
- `tests/test_file_manager.py` — updated assertions for row_count fix
- `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py` — 1 new test (3 → 4)

**Test suite:** 150 tests (146 unit + 4 integration), all pass.

### v6.2.1 - 2026-02-20 - Final Review Polish (4 items from third review)

Addresses 4 minor items identified in third external review (rated 9.1/10, prompt.md). Also caught and fixed a latent production bug via the new integration tests.

**Fixes:**
- **Classifier test now imports from source** (`brain/nodes/classifier.py` + `tests/test_classifier.py`): Extracted inline fallback list to `_FALLBACK_ORDER` module-level constant. All 5 classifier tests now import from the source instead of hardcoding the list. If the fallback order changes, the tests catch it.
- **test_valid_outputs_dir .resolve() bug** (`tests/test_sandbox.py`): Added `.resolve()` before path validation to handle symlinks and non-canonical paths.
- **Planner format string crash** (`brain/nodes/planner.py`): `CAPABILITIES_BLOCK` contained unescaped `{` `}` in a JSON example (`json={"model": ...}`). When concatenated into `CODE_SYSTEM` and processed by `.format(tdd=...)`, Python raised `KeyError: '"model"'`. This was a latent production bug affecting all code/data/file/automation tasks — caught by the new integration tests. Fixed by escaping to `{{` `}}`.

**New files:**
- `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py` — 4 integration tests: full pipeline success, retry-then-pass, max retries exhausted. Uses `MockClaude` class that returns stage-appropriate responses based on call signatures. Chains node functions directly (no langgraph dependency at test time).

**Modified files:**
- `brain/nodes/classifier.py` — extracted `_FALLBACK_ORDER` constant
- `brain/nodes/planner.py` — escaped braces in `CAPABILITIES_BLOCK` JSON example
- `tests/test_classifier.py` — imports `_FALLBACK_ORDER` from source
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — `.resolve()` in `test_valid_outputs_dir`

**Test suite:** 102 tests (98 unit + 4 integration), all pass.

### v6.2 - 2026-02-20 - Operational Hardening (external review response)

Addresses gaps identified in two independent external reviews (rated 8.2/10 and 9.5/10). Focuses on operational reliability: resource management, budget enforcement, storage lifecycle, rate limiting, and automated testing.

**New features:**
- **RAM guard + concurrency cap** (`bot/handlers.py`): `handle_message()` checks system RAM (via `psutil`) and active task count before launching pipeline. Rejects new tasks if RAM > 90% or concurrent tasks >= 3 (both env-configurable via `RAM_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`, `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`). Same RAM check in `_scheduled_task_run()` — skips scheduled tasks under memory pressure with a warning log.
- **Budget enforcement** (`tools/claude_client.py`): `_check_budget()` runs before every API call. Queries daily and monthly spend from the `api_usage` table against `DAILY_BUDGET_USD` and `MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` limits. Raises `BudgetExceededError` (subclass of `RuntimeError`) if exceeded. Prevents unattended cost runaway from scheduled tasks in retry loops.
- **Rate limiter** (`bot/handlers.py`): 5-second per-user cooldown between task submissions. Prevents accidental double-sends and Telegram message deduplication issues.
- **SQLite WAL mode** (`storage/db.py`): `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` in `init_db()`. Eliminates `SQLITE_BUSY` errors under concurrent writes from multiple pipeline threads.
- **Storage auto-cleanup** (`storage/db.py` + `main.py`): On startup, prunes conversation_history > 30 days, api_usage > 90 days, and workspace files (outputs + uploads) > 7 days. Prevents unbounded SSD growth on the Mac Mini.
- **Expanded command safety** (`tools/sandbox.py`): 8 new blocked patterns (20 total): `sudo`, `curl|sh`, `curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `wget|bash`, `chmod 777 /~`, `chmod -R`. 2 new audit log patterns: network downloads, pip install from URL.
- **Enhanced /health** (`bot/handlers.py`): Now shows RAM usage (used/total/%), active tasks (N/max), plus all existing health info.
- **Automated test suite** (`tests/`): 98 pytest tests across 6 test files covering sandbox safety (27 blocked + 10 allowed patterns), auditor JSON extraction (12 edge cases), executor code block extraction (8 tests), classifier fallback ordering (5 tests), file manager metadata (10 tests), and budget enforcement (5 tests).

**New files:**
- `tests/__init__.py`
- `tests/test_sandbox.py` — 47 tests (blocked patterns, allowed commands, working dir, pip mapping, import error parsing, traceback extraction)
- `tests/test_auditor.py` — 12 tests (JSON extraction with nested braces, stray chars, missing keys)
- `tests/test_executor.py` — 12 tests (markdown block extraction, timeout estimation)
- `tests/test_classifier.py` — 5 tests (fallback ordering)
- `tests/test_file_manager.py` — 10 tests (CSV metadata, empty files, truncation)
- `tests/test_budget.py` — 5 tests (budget enforcement, model costs)

**Modified files:**
- `config.py` — added `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`, `RAM_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`
- `requirements.txt` — added `psutil>=5.9.0`
- `tools/sandbox.py` — 8 new blocked patterns (sudo, pipe-to-shell, chmod), 2 new audit patterns
- `tools/claude_client.py` — `BudgetExceededError`, `_check_budget()`, wired into `call()`
- `storage/db.py` — WAL mode in `init_db()`, `prune_old_data()`, `cleanup_workspace_files()`
- `bot/handlers.py` — `_check_resources()`, rate limiter, RAM guard in handle_message + scheduled, enhanced cmd_health
- `main.py` — storage cleanup on startup

### v2 - 2026-02-19 - Project Registry + Reliability Upgrades

**New features:**
- **Project registry** (`projects.yaml` + `tools/projects.py`): 8 registered projects with trigger-based matching, named commands, timeout configuration, and file requirement flags. Agent invokes existing codebases instead of writing new code.
- **Shell execution mode** (`tools/sandbox.py` `run_shell()`): executes project commands in their working directories with venv activation, custom environment variables, and file-creation detection.
- **Cross-model adversarial auditing**: executor uses Sonnet (DEFAULT_MODEL), auditor uses Opus (COMPLEX_MODEL). Different model reviews the work to prevent echo-chamber self-approval.
- **TDD assertions** (`brain/nodes/planner.py` TDD_INSTRUCTION): planner instructs Claude to write `assert` statements in all generated code. Auditor checks for "ALL ASSERTIONS PASSED" in output.
- **Full traceback injection** (`tools/sandbox.py` `_extract_traceback()`): on execution failure, the exact Python traceback with file names and line numbers is extracted from stderr and fed back to the planner/executor for precise fixes.
- **Streaming status**: handler updates the Telegram status message in real-time as pipeline stages progress (Classifying... Planning... Executing... Auditing... Delivering...). Thread-safe stage tracking in `brain/graph.py`.
- **`/schedule` command**: schedule recurring tasks via Telegram with interval in minutes. Subcommands: `list`, `remove <id>`. Fires the full pipeline and sends results to the originating chat.
- **`/projects` command**: lists all registered projects with their available commands and trigger keywords.
- **SQLite-backed APScheduler job store**: scheduled tasks persist in a separate SQLite database (`storage/scheduler.db`) and survive process restarts and machine reboots. Separate DB avoids lock contention with the main aiosqlite task database.
- **Concurrency fix**: running tasks tracked by `dict[task_id -> future]` instead of a single variable. Multiple tasks can run concurrently. `/status` shows all active tasks. `/cancel` cancels all.

**New files:**
- `projects.yaml` -- project registry (8 projects)
- `tools/projects.py` -- registry loader, trigger matcher, context formatter

**Modified files:**
- `brain/state.py` -- added `project_name`, `project_config`, `stage` fields (16 total, up from 13)
- `brain/graph.py` -- added thread-safe stage tracking (`set_stage`, `get_stage`, `clear_stage`), `_wrap_node()` wrapper
- `brain/nodes/classifier.py` -- added fast-path project trigger matching before Claude call, injected project summary into classification prompt
- `brain/nodes/planner.py` -- added PROJECT_SYSTEM prompt, TDD_INSTRUCTION constant, project context injection
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` -- added `_execute_project()` path with SHELL_GEN_SYSTEM prompt and `run_shell()` invocation, added `_format_result()` with traceback injection
- `brain/nodes/auditor.py` -- switched to COMPLEX_MODEL for cross-model review, added project-specific audit criteria, added `_extract_json()` fallback
- `brain/nodes/deliverer.py` -- added project-specific success message formatting
- `bot/telegram_bot.py` -- registered `/projects` and `/schedule` command handlers (7 total, up from 5)
- `bot/handlers.py` -- added `cmd_projects`, `cmd_schedule`, streaming status loop in `handle_message`, changed task tracking from single variable to dict
- `tools/sandbox.py` -- added `run_shell()`, `_extract_traceback()`, added `traceback` and `return_code` fields to `ExecutionResult`
- `scheduler/cron.py` -- switched from in-memory to SQLAlchemyJobStore, added `remove_job()` with partial ID matching
- `config.py` -- added `COMPLEX_MODEL`, `PROJECTS_DIR`
- `requirements.txt` -- added `pyyaml>=6.0.0`, `sqlalchemy>=2.0.0`
- `main.py` -- added project registry loading on startup

### v2.2 - 2026-02-19 - Security Hardening + Persistence (prompt.md audit)

**Fixes and improvements (from architectural audit):**
- **Bot HTTP session leak fixed** (`bot/handlers.py`): `_scheduled_task_run()` now uses `async with Bot(token=...) as bot:` context manager to properly close the `httpx.AsyncClient` session after each scheduled run. Previously created an unclosed session that would exhaust the connection pool over time.
- **Zombie stage leak fixed** (`bot/handlers.py`): Added `clear_stage(task_id)` to `handle_message()`'s `finally` block as a belt-and-suspenders guard against orphaned stage entries in the `_task_stages` dict.
- **Command blocklist in sandbox** (`tools/sandbox.py`): `run_shell()` now checks commands against 11 destructive patterns (`rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, `shutdown`, `reboot`, `fork bomb`, `chmod -R 777 /`, `systemctl stop/disable`, `launchctl unload`) before execution. Blocked commands return `ExecutionResult(success=False)` with a security warning. Safe commands (single-file rm, normal chmod, pip install, etc.) pass through.
- **Persistent API usage tracking** (`tools/claude_client.py`): Usage records now persist to SQLite (`api_usage` table in `agentsutra.db`) via synchronous `sqlite3` with a `threading.Lock`. Survives process restarts. `get_usage_summary()` now reads from DB (lifetime totals, not just session). Thread-safe by design since `claude_client.py` runs inside `asyncio.to_thread()` worker threads.
- **Database lock prevention** (`storage/db.py`): All 5 `aiosqlite.connect()` calls now include `timeout=20.0` to prevent `"database is locked"` exceptions when concurrent LangGraph pipelines write simultaneously.
- **Synchronous sleep warning** (`tools/claude_client.py`): Added docstring warning on `call()` that `time.sleep()` is safe only because of `asyncio.to_thread()` execution context.
- **Deployment hardening script** (`scripts/secure_deploy.sh`): New script that sets `chmod 444` on config files (`projects.yaml`, `USECASES.md`, `.env`), creates workspace directories with correct permissions, and installs a daily 3am cron job backing up `workspace/`, `storage/`, and `projects.yaml` with 7-day retention.

**New files:**
- `scripts/secure_deploy.sh` -- deployment hardening script

**Modified files:**
- `bot/handlers.py` -- `async with Bot()` context manager, `clear_stage()` in finally
- `tools/sandbox.py` -- `_BLOCKED_PATTERNS`, `_check_command_safety()`, wired into `run_shell()`
- `tools/claude_client.py` -- `_init_usage_db()`, `_persist_usage()`, rewritten `get_usage_summary()`, docstring warning
- `storage/db.py` -- `timeout=20.0` on all connections

### v2.1 - 2026-02-19 - Bug Fixes (4 bugs found in deep review)

**Bug fixes:**
- **CRITICAL: `/schedule` crash fix** -- Refactored scheduled task callback from a local closure to a module-level `_scheduled_task_run()` function. Local closures cannot be pickled by APScheduler's SQLAlchemyJobStore, causing an immediate `AttributeError` crash on every `/schedule` command. New function accepts only serializable kwargs and creates a fresh `Bot` instance from `config.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
- **MODERATE: Heredoc delimiter collision fix** -- Changed the shell heredoc delimiter from fixed `AGENTSUTRA_SCRIPT` to randomized `AGENTSUTRA_EOF_<uuid>` in executor's `_execute_project()`. Prevents the edge case where Claude-generated code contains the literal delimiter string, which would cause premature heredoc termination.
- **MODERATE: Separate scheduler database** -- APScheduler's SQLAlchemyJobStore now uses `storage/scheduler.db` instead of sharing `storage/agentsutra.db` with aiosqlite. Concurrent writes from both SQLAlchemy (sync, APScheduler updates) and aiosqlite (async, task CRUD) to the same SQLite file caused `database is locked` errors under load.
- **LOW: Stale Bot session fix** -- Resolved by the `/schedule` refactor above. Previously captured `context.bot` from the handler invocation; now creates a fresh `Bot` instance per scheduled execution, avoiding stale HTTP sessions on long-lived schedules.

**Modified files:**
- `bot/handlers.py` -- extracted `_scheduled_task_run()` to module level, added `Bot` import
- `brain/nodes/executor.py` -- randomized heredoc delimiter, added `uuid` import
- `scheduler/cron.py` -- separate `scheduler.db` path
