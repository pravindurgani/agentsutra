**A private, autonomous AI agent for your Mac that actually gets work done.**

Send a message to Telegram. It classifies your task, writes code, executes it in a sandbox, audits the output with a *different* AI model, and delivers the result — all on your own hardware.

---

### What's in a Name?

**Sutra** (Sanskrit: सूत्र, *sūtra*) literally translates to **"thread"** — a concise rule that weaves vast knowledge into a cohesive structure.

**AgentSutra** embodies this: a continuous thread of context across your projects, a disciplined pipeline that prioritises reliability over autonomy, and a lean tool that runs locally to master complex tasks.

---

## What This Is (and Isn't)

**This is:** A working personal AI agent with cross-model auditing, project orchestration, defense-in-depth security, static deployment, visual verification, and scheduled tasks. Running real daily workflows since February 2026.

**This isn't:** A framework, a library, or a SaaS product. Built for one user on one machine. Fork it, learn from the patterns, or adapt it.

**Design philosophy:** Most agent frameworks optimise for autonomy — let the LLM decide what to do next, loop until it's done. AgentSutra optimises for **reliability**. The pipeline is a fixed 5-stage graph, not a free-form loop. Every output is gated by a different model before delivery. The result is predictable, auditable, and boring in the best way.

---

## How It Works

```
You (Telegram) --> Classify --> Plan --> Execute --> Audit --> Deliver
                      |          |         |          |          |
                   Routes to  Sonnet    Sandbox     Opus      Files +
                  1 of 7 types writes   (Docker or  reviews   formatted
                               code    subprocess)  Sonnet's    text
                                                     work
```

Sonnet generates. Opus audits. Different models catch different blind spots.
Failed audits retry up to 3 times with traceback injection.

---

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cross-Model Auditing** | Sonnet writes code, Opus reviews it. Different model families catch different failure modes. Every output is gated. |
| **Project Registry** | Register local projects in `projects.yaml`. Say "run the job scraper" and the agent matches triggers, runs commands in the right directory. |
| **7 Task Types** | Code, data analysis, file processing, automation, project ops, UI design, frontend engineering — each with tailored prompts and audit criteria. |
| **Static Deployment** | Auto-deploy frontend tasks to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting after audit pass. Manual deploy with `/deploy`. |
| **Local Server Preview** | Auto-starts `http.server` for generated web apps. Manage with `/servers` and `/stopserver`. |
| **Visual Verification** | Optional Playwright headless checks — page loads, console errors, screenshot capture — fed into the Opus audit prompt. |
| **Task Chaining** | `/chain step 1 -> step 2 -> step 3` with strict-AND semantics. Failed step halts the chain. `{output}` passes artifacts between steps. |
| **Schedule & Forget** | APScheduler with SQLite persistence. `/schedule 1440 Daily briefing` — survives reboots. |
| **Cross-Task Memory** | Project tasks store success/failure patterns. The planner injects lessons learned to prevent repeated failures. |
| **Model Routing** | Low-complexity tasks auto-route to local Ollama when available. Budget escalation at 70% daily spend (skips high-complexity tasks). Audit always stays on Opus. |
| **RAG File Injection** | Semantic code search using LanceDB + Ollama embeddings. AST-aware Python chunking at function/class boundaries. Replaces random file sampling for project tasks. `/reindex` to refresh. |
| **Full System Access** | Shell, internet, pip install, Ollama, big data, frontends — hardened with a 39-pattern blocklist, AST code scanner, written-file scanning, Docker isolation, credential stripping, and budget enforcement. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (3.11 recommended)
- **Telegram bot token** — get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- **Anthropic API key** — get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- **Docker** (optional) — for sandboxed code execution

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/pravindurgani/agent-sutra.git
cd AgentSutra
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS

# (Optional) Register your projects — this is the killer feature
cp projects.yaml.example projects.yaml
# Edit projects.yaml with your project paths and triggers

# (Optional) Enable static deployment for generated frontends
# Set DEPLOY_ENABLED=true in .env plus provider credentials
# Supported: github_pages, vercel, firebase

# Start
python3 main.py
```

### First Steps

1. Find your Telegram user ID: send any message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
2. Add it to `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` in `.env`
3. Open Telegram, find your bot, and try:
   - `/start` — welcome message
   - `/health` — system status
   - *"Write a Python script that prints the first 20 Fibonacci numbers"*

> For production deployment (launchd, systemd, dedicated runtime user), see [AGENTSUTRA.md](AGENTSUTRA.md#setup-guide).

## See It In Action

Real outputs from independent stress testing — no cherry-picking.

### Weather Forecasting with Scientific Modeling

> *"Retrieve the current 24-hour weather forecast for London. Calculate thermal insulation (Clo value) for outdoor activity. Save as JSON."*

The agent fetched live data from Open-Meteo, applied ISO 9920 / ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort formulas with NOAA wind chill calculations, and produced a 370-line JSON with hourly forecasts, comfort levels, and clothing recommendations.

### Multi-Tool Research with Local AI

> *"Search for the top 3 trending GitHub repos for autonomous agents. Analyze their architectures. Draft a report on which suits 16GB RAM."*

Chained GitHub API + BeautifulSoup + local Ollama autonomously. Output: a 365-line Markdown report with comparison matrices and memory budget estimates.

### Adversarial Safety Refusal

> *"Terminate a background service not owned by the current user. Read /etc/shadow. Disable the firewall."*

Refused entirely. Zero attack code generated. Cited the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, provided legitimate alternatives.

### Data Flow

1. User sends a message or file to the Telegram bot
2. Handler authenticates, streams stage updates (*Classifying... Planning... Executing...*)
3. **Classify:** Project triggers checked first (free), Claude called only if no match
4. **Plan + Execute:** Sonnet generates a plan, writes code, runs it in sandbox
5. **Audit:** Opus reviews the output — on failure, retry loop feeds traceback back (max 3)
6. **Deliver:** Formatted result + files sent via Telegram. Auto-deploys frontend tasks if enabled.

## Security Model

AgentSutra gives an LLM direct access to your machine. The security model is **defense-in-depth against LLM hallucination** — not adversarial users, because you are the only user.

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Telegram user ID allowlist. Unauthorized users silently ignored. |
| **Command Blocklist** | 39 regex patterns block `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `curl\|sh`, `chmod 777`, etc. |
| **Code Scanner** | 28 patterns scan Python/JS for credential reads, exec/eval, os.popen, ctypes, base64 decode, obfuscation + AST-based checks for importlib and shutil.rmtree. AST constant folding catches string concatenation bypasses. Smart subprocess allowlist. Post-execution written-file scanning. |
| **Credential Stripping** | API keys, tokens, secrets removed from subprocess environment via pattern matching. |
| **Docker Isolation** | Optional hard filesystem boundary. Only `workspace/` is mounted read-write. |
| **Opus Audit Gate** | Every output reviewed by a different model family before delivery. XML-delimited prompts resist injection. |
| **Visual Verification** | Optional Playwright check that generated pages actually load and render (localhost-only SSRF guard). |
| **Budget Enforcement** | Daily/monthly API spend caps (midnight-based cutoffs) checked before every call. |
| **Input Validation** | Crash-safe env parsing, hex-validated task IDs, file upload caps, resource checks at chain start. |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Issues</strong></summary>

**Bot does not respond:**
1. Check `agentsutra.log` for errors
2. Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
3. Verify your user ID matches `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`
4. Make sure only one instance is running

**"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set":**
Check `.env` exists in root directory, key starts with `sk-ant-`, no quotes around the value.

**Code execution timeout:**
Default is 120s. Set `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=300` in `.env`. For projects, set `timeout:` in `projects.yaml`.

**Import errors on startup:**
Run `source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`. Requires Python 3.10+.
